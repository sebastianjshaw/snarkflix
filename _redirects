# Netlify redirects for social media sharing
# This file tells Netlify how to handle review URLs for social media crawlers

# Handle review URLs with hash fragments
# When a social media crawler hits a review URL, redirect to a special page
# that will serve the appropriate meta tags

# For now, we'll redirect all review URLs to the main page
# The JavaScript will handle the routing client-side
