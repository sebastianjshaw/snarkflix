        aiSummary: "tldr: James Gunn breathes fresh, colourful life into Superman, delivering the hopeful hero Snyder never could, complete with perfectly snarky Lois, a petty genius Lex, and a hilariously awkward accidental allegory on immigration and geopolitical invasions. It's exactly the fun reboot DC desperately needed.",
        tagline: "I'm glad Snyder is still alive to see this film and see how fully, fundamentally and totally he failed as a screenwriter, director, and person.",
        content: "All in all, this was the hopeful superman we all wanted and haven't seen on the big screen in a couple of decades. The colour pallet was cheerful in the right places, and whilst it perhaps lacked some of Snyders visual beauty, it more than overcame that with just getting the tone right.\n\nIt's a very James Gunn film, so there's quips and sillyness, there are minor characters who are very different from their comic counterparts, but unlike Snyder they are still respected. An example is the use of the Engineer as a Lex soldier. This takes away her agency by having him be the mastermind of the nano-machines which is disappointing. In the comics she does this herself and joins the ruthless Authority. (Though the universe merge of the Authority and DC never really made sense to me)\n\nLex was amazing, the pettiness and general insanity are fantastic. His storage unit of people who have slighted him is chef's kiss. It's the first time in a long time we're seeing the Lex who plans and who's power is so great he can stand toe to toe with Superman, shielded by his intelligence and his ruthlessness.\n\nDavid was great as both Clark & Superman and it was brilliant to see a film start mid-universe not with the origin stories.\n\nLois is great and her pinning Clark to the wall over and over again in their interview was hilarious and the reason she is Pulizer winning and he tends to get it for his novels not his journalism.\n\nMr Terrific was great, though the Mobius Chair look is odd. Guy Gardner is top tier.\n\nGary was great. Justice for Gary.\n\nCool to see such a good use of Metamorpho, including his flying head. It's a shame we'll never get to his partner's appearance in Sandman because Gaiman 'allegedly' can't keep it in his pants.\n\nKrypto is a very good boi.\n\nIts weird we got the Boy's ending/twist that we never got in the Boys. Like it was very obvious from the moment we saw Ultraman's outfit what was coming, but it was a weird choice, like Gunn accidentally copied from the wrong material.\n\nThere's also two plot elements that are really blown up by recent events and I'm not sure either could have been planned due to the time it takes to produce a movie.\n\nSuperman gets arrested by ICE for being an immigrant.\n\nJames Gunn having to come out and insist his invasion in the desert of white europeans led by a traitorous warmonger with an eastern European accent against an oppressed brown population in poverty but who are called terrorists so the invaders can steal the land is not about Isreal and Palestine and all the above is just some weird coincidence is.... something.\n\nA promising start to DC's umpteenth reboot.",

        content: "I, like many people, have been holding space for the lyrics of defying gravity and for this review.\n\nElphaba's mother had an affair with the Wizard. I'm not sure if we're supposed to know that at this stage or if he's supposed to be a mysterious stranger, but its very obviously Jeff Goldblum.\n\nThe parents are strangely horrified by Elphaba being born with green skin given they have a wolf for a midwife and a bear for a nurse.\n\n\"It's alright little one, he shouldn't have blamed you\" Child Elphaba is told by a random bear. Even though she did the thing she was blamed for.\n\nGlinda goes full wickerman on a statue of Elphaba as the townspeople cheer and dance.\n\nThe bubble is fantastic, beautifully done, slightly wobbly and when it pops there's a very subtle rainbow in the air. Love it very much.\n\nThe framing of Wicked is a random townsperson asks Glinda if it was true she was Elphaba's friend on her way out of the village and basically Glinda decides to info dump. Good for us, the audience, probably a pretty frustrating afternoon for the townspeople who had other things to do than sit through five hours of the Good Witch waxing lyrical about her school days.\n\nGlinda goes full Plastic with her 'Blick' and \"strangers are just people I've never met\"\n\nThe students at Shiz are also shocked, horrified and pitying of the girl with green skin. They are completely unphased by the two professors who are talking animals.\n\nWe're told by the staff that true magic is increasingly rare. Naturally Elphaba, who's only supposed to be giving Nessarose assistance to her room gets annoyed and does her levitating trick. Madam Morrible claims credit to keep things quiet, fast tracks her into the school, and plans to privately tutor her. Galinda's horrified that she, for once, hasn't got her way.\n\nThe section of the Wizard and I where she sings about 'de-greenify' is beautifully shot with light coming through spinning coloured glass changing her skin tone through a rainbow.\n\nI think we're supposed to think Galinda's being unfair by only giving a little space to Elphaba in her room, but honestly she was railroaded into having a roommate in her room. She's been reasonably decent about the whole thing and Elphaba's got a pretty big chip on her shoulder about the whole thing for someone who wasn't supposed to be at that school twenty minutes ago. One of the challenges is Ariana Grande is such a likeable person, it carries over to Galinda and its hard to separate it.\n\nGalinda ramps up the mean girl nastiness in front of the animal professor of history and also asks some profoundly stupid questions. \"Poppy's are my favourite, they keep me cheerful in these dark times\" is a doubly cutting comment from the depressed Goat given their medicinal use and their symbolism.\n\nElphaba follows Dr Dilamond and listens in to his private conversations with his friends. He's pretty unfazed by her breach of basic decency. Animals are losing the ability to speak. This is a bit of a horrifying thing to have as a B plot.\n\nFirst Elphaba and then Galinda meet the charming rogue of our story, who is unbothered by Galinda's skin colour and leads the students in a big dance number. His name's Fiyero. He's a student at Shiz. Even though Cynthia and Ariana are hardly school age, this guy gives strong \"How do you do fellow kids\" or the elderly Luke Perry in 90210. The actor is closer to forty than thirty, his child would be a more appropriate age to attend Shiz. Perhaps he is a mature student.\n\nThe roommate scene was already very close to the roommates scene in Wednesday. We then get a very very similar dancing movements from Elphaba at the ball. Galinda, feeling like a pretty terrible person for her behaviour (as Elphaba got her into the sorcery program) mimics her weird crazy person dancing. Ariana manages to bring a certain grace to the odd movements, but Elphaba continues looking like a puppet with an ungainly puppeteer.\n\nThe girls share some secrets and Galinda love bombs the hell out of \"Elphie\". Given no one other than a Goat and an elderly student has ever shown Elphaba even the most basic human kindness this is extremely effective. We then get one of the best songs in the show, Popular.\n\nThe animal Professor tells us it's his last day, and that animals will no longer be allowed to teach. Immediately after that he's dragged off campus by the police. Its a bit weird. I'd honestly have cut the bit with him saying they were not able to speak any more.\n\nApparently 'cages' are a new innovation in Oz. (Which must make it very easy to escape from an Oz prison.) It (rightly) pisses off Elphaba so much she uses her magic to put everyone but Fiyero into an opium induced sleep. Fiyero breaks the cub out of the cage without hesitation. His characterisation is basically Charlie \"Wild Card\" Kelly at this point, its deeply inconsistent. Fiyero questions why he was the only one she didn't effect with the spell, I'd just assumed it was because unlike the other students he's developed a tolerance to opioids due to his many, many, decades of life.\n\nElphaba is summoned to the Wizard, and brings Galinda (now Glinda in solidarity of Dr Dilamond). As they explore the city we're treated to Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth on stage vying for attention on stage during a retelling of the Wizards arrival.\n\nWe get the \"I am Oz the great and terrible\" and then Jeff comes out to say hello and do some very terrible up close magic for us. The Wizard does to Glinda what she did to Boq at the start, calling her Balinda. He's basically playing Grandmaster or Zeus from his more recent outings. All Ego driven generosity. He's pretty much Glinda all grown up.\n\nThe Grimmerie is a deeply inconvenient shape for a book. There's a reason we use rectangles. It's a bit 'different just to be different' honestly. But Elphie casts a spell, as the Wizard and Morrible planned, granting wings to their monkey guards. Elphaba figures out the Wizards a fraud and all his magic is fake.\n\nMorrible rallies the flying monkeys to chase Elphaba telling them \"she did this\" maybe its just me, but if someone gave me giant cool wings that let me fly I'd not be angry and chasing them down, I'd be protecting them. Wings would be AMAZING!\n\nGlinda kills a guy. He's grabbed her leg as they try and escape in the Wizards balloon, and she hits him with a sandbag. he then falls maybe 3 stories to land spine first on a wooden floor.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba face off, and then we get Wicked's best song. I hate to say it, but Cynthia's third for me, after seeing Idina on stage in London and (don't judge me!) Kurt & Rachel face off in Glee.\n\nWith hat and cloak from Glinda, Grimmarie from the wizard and broom by her own craft Elphaba defies gravity.\n\nWorth noting the guards are useless. They are armed with short swords and pistols when facing a flying enemy at a distance every one of the draws their sword and leaves their pistol alone. There would be no sequel if even one guard had been trained.\n\nThe film does suffer from being way too long. Its 2h 40 mins and that's only half of the total film. Its been split in two. The first film is already longer than the stage adaption.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: Miyazaki's latest film is a weird rollercoaster of war orphans, family drama, giant birds, and magical nonsense wrapped in Ghibli's trademark charm. The animation is stunning, but starting to feel dated against newer anime powerhouses (Demon Slayer says hi). The story is packed with odd choices, like a morally questionable dad, creepy herons, and some wildly unhinged plot twists that are both hilarious and head-scratching. The English dub flaunts A-list names, but their performances don't hold a candle to seasoned voice actors. It's bizarrely personal and familiar in that classic Miyazaki way, but it lacks the fresh magic of his best work.",
        tagline: "Miyazaki is never bad, but this film reuses too many of his staples to truly be great.",
        content: "Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and naturally produced by Studio Ghibli, this was the film Miyazaki came out of retirement (again) to direct before retiring (again) upon its completion.\n\nIt starts with common Miyazaki themes: a young boy affected by a war, an incomplete family moving out of a city to a new home in the countryside. In this case, it's so his father can hook up with his dead wife's sister. Like much of Miyazaki's work, the father is absent from much of the film. But given that he's apparently a scumbag, that's perhaps for the best.\n\n\"I'm going to be your new mother from now on. Sound good?\" is an unhinged thing to say to your war-orphan nephew. Having him feel the baby move and telling him it's a new sister or brother immediately had me rooting against this woman and the philandering father.\n\nThe artwork is, of course, impeccable, but the approach and style are showing their age compared to newer anime like Demon Slayer.\n\nJust after they arrive at his new home, and his father's new factory is pointed out in the distance, we see the grey heron for the first time. It flies inside the home briefly, and we're told it's unusual. His new home is expansive, richly appointed, and weirdly similar to the house in one season of Tenchi Muyo! He doesn't live in it, though. He stays in a more regular house nearby.\n\nWe're introduced to a gaggle of potato-faced old women who are all about three feet tall. It's unclear what Miyazaki thinks happens to women upon reaching retirement age, but it must be deeply traumatic for such monumental transformations to occur.\n\nThe boy has a horrifying dream of his mother burning alive and ascending...somewhere. He is running through the flames. Later, the heron leads him to a tower, which he's told was built by his grandmother's uncle, who apparently read too many books and lost his mind. Remember, kids, reading is BAD!\n\nHe gets into a fight at school, but apparently deciding it wasn't serious enough, he bashes his own head in with a rock until blood flows freely down his face. It's weird. He does such a severe job of it that a doctor needs to visit and do stitches. It's also weird when his father says he will get vengeance against whichever child did this to his flesh and blood. Luckily, things get more normal when the heron arrives and says the boy's name a few times.\n\nThe boy heads out with a rattan to confront the heron. It snaps the wooden sword easily with its beak full of human teeth and tells him his mother is not dead. Then there's a chorus of fish and frogs swarming over him, saying, \"Join us, join us!\" His mother-aunt shoots an arrow at the heron and drives the creatures away.\n\nAfter some faffing around, a bit of petty larceny, and some time sharpening a knife, he crafts a bow like his aunt's but from bamboo. It's useless because it's bamboo. He's lucky it hasn't snapped already. He fletches the arrow with a heron feather. He also seems to eat a lot of glue in the process, which explains a few things. The heron feather arrow is magically good.\n\nHe stalks through the forest with one of the potato women, who tries to stop him from going into the tower. He is aware the claim that his mother is alive is a lie and admits he's not that bothered about rescuing his aunt. He just needs confirmation on his mother and is willing to risk the trip. It's pretty hilarious how indifferent he is about his aunt.\n\nThere's a creepy man inside the heron. He's much less threatening once his costume is damaged. He does give off pedophile vibes. The boy then sinks through the floor into a new world, where a pirate saves him from a flock of pelicans at the gates of a graveyard.\n\nWe get a moment typical of a Miyazaki film, a gaggle of tiny, cute creatures! These look exactly like the Adipose from Doctor Who.\n\nThe boy is stoic. There's no other word for it. Despite the strangeness and terror he's facing, he stands firm before it, his voice and demeanor never wavering. It's a common trope in anime for young men.\n\nThere is much akin to Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away in his exploration of this new world, but with more outhouses.\n\nWe cut back to the 'real' world, where the boy's father stops his factory workers from continuing to search for his pregnant sister-in-law/wife and his son so they don't fall behind schedule. I'm assuming he knows of a third sister he can hook up with.\n\nHe meets Himi. She's made of fire and says Nasuko is her sister. I'm sure the fire is just a coincidence to how the boy's mum burned alive. She info-drops that the tower can straddle all different kinds of worlds. We move on, no further questions. We can be sure she's a monster because she puts butter in between the bread and jam for him. He opens up to Himi that his mother's dead. She cheerfully says, \"Mine too!\" No further questions are asked there either.\n\n\"Be careful; in here there are limits to what my power can do,\" Himi tells him in the corridor of doors (a very Midkemia Hall of Worlds reference), which is a terrifying thing to say when you pause and think about it, because it implies there are no limits to her power normally.\n\nThey release an army of giant birds into the real world through the door. The father chops at them with a sword, and then they turn into budgies. The father appears to be slowly losing his mind. Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.\n\nHimi waits until he's electrocuted to tell him not to touch the stone. She's a little bit of a bitch, tbh. He finds his aunt, and she tells him to leave and that she hates him.\n\nThe boy meets his great-granduncle, the tower master. His uncle is playing with children's blocks piled up as a tower. By this point, the boy is dressed like John McClane in Die Hard. The uncle, who would have been a 19th-century Japanese architect, is wearing a black robe adorned with a necklace of turquoise gems, hair that would put Einstein to shame, and a mustache greater even than Sam Elliott's. So he either always was an odd fish, or since joining the tower, gave himself a makeover. The uncle puts a heavy burden on the boy and tells him it's his responsibility to choose which block will be used in his toy tower.\n\nThe boy then wakes up chained to a wall in the budgies' kitchen, only to be rescued by the creepy heron-man. They sneak out of the way comically easily.\n\nAfter a deep conversation with his granduncle, he returns to his world, turning down the chance to create a world of his own. After King Birdman destroys the building blocks and the granduncle starts to die, he tells the boy to run. The boy doesn't even hesitate. He grabs Himi and sprints off, leaving his granduncle to his (well-deserved) fate. The tower collapses. Turns out Himi is his mother! (shock!) and she has to go through a different door. The boy's calling his aunt \"mother\" now for some reason. Seems like a bit of a slap in the face to his actual mother, who's standing right next to him.\n\nThe large birds follow them out the door and turn into small budgies as before. They shit all over the aunt, who giggles, saying, \"So cute.\" It's weird. Everyone kind of arrives together, and the film ends.\n\nThe film is strange and odd in that very special Ghibli way. You forgive the peculiarities because they come with such charm. It's not his most groundbreaking work, but somehow, it's one of his most personal, reflecting his own childhood. In feeling, if not in giant birds filled with men. My opinion of it is colored, I think, by my initial impression of the father and aunt hooking up and having a baby together more or less on the bones of the boy's mother. It's hard to root for her being saved.\n\nThe voice actors for the English dub are very high profile: Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Willem Dafoe, Christian Bale. But a continuing trend of hiring famous actors to do voice work rather than professional voice actors shows.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: This movie is a low-budget, high-concept gem where all the action happens in one dude's house. John Oldman casually drops a bombshell to his friends: he's a 14,000-year-old Cro-Magnon who's hung out with history's VIPs, from Buddha to Van Gogh, and—plot twist—claims to have inspired Jesus. The group debates whether he's a fraud or the real deal, but the story stays just convincing enough to mess with your head. No flashy effects here, just one actor absolutely carrying the film. The ending sneaks up on you with an emotional gut-punch that's both abrupt and effective.",
        tagline: "A surprisingly engaging movie with an unusual premise.",
        content: "It was TikTok that introduced me to this movie, its all-knowing algorithm presenting clips it knew I'd enjoy.\n\nThe entire film is staged in a couple of rooms in John Oldman's house and a little outside by his truck. It's a film where almost nothing happens except one struggle over a gun and a medical emergency. Every other moment is John telling his life story—or telling a wild, fantastical tale.\n\nJohn tells his circle of friends he is a Cro-Magnon man, 14,000 years old. Every ten years or so, he moves so no one notices he doesn't age. His friends, colleagues from the university he teaches at, naturally don't believe him at first and challenge him over and over again.\n\nThey, like us, begin to wonder though—the story hangs together, it makes sense, though he has managed to meet a great many of the most famous people in history. He studied with Buddha. He had the chance to sail with Columbus (but was still slightly concerned there was an edge to the world). He has a Van Gogh painting given to him by the artist. Until one asks if he's ever been a religious figure. It takes some pushing, but he admits he was the basis for Jesus. His most religious friend calls it blasphemy. He simply claims he tried passing on some of Buddha's teachings and then a lot of extra things were attributed to him in the texts.\n\nThe movie ends a little abruptly, with him mentioning where he was ten years before and dropping a name—a name that causes one of his friends to suffer a heart attack in sudden and complete certainty that he knew John's previous identity.\n\nThe cinematography is fine; it's a pretty simple setup, ordinarily lit but personal, as suits the premise. The whole film hangs on John's performance, and you're never quite sure if he's a playful liar trying to ease the sting of his sudden departure or a man deciding to be honest for the first time in an eon.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: In a world craving innovation, \"Wonka\" serves up a stale, half-baked confection. Timothée Chalamet, while easy on the eyes, falls short of the enigmatic chocolatier's legacy, delivering more of a petulant child than a master of confectionary wonders. Set against a backdrop that screams a confused homage to every popular franchise of the last two decades, this film meanders through a plot thinner than budget supermarket chocolate. The attempt to blend humour with a dark origin story leaves a taste as unsatisfying as sugar-free gum. It's a cinematic equivalent of finding a raisin in your chocolate bar - utterly disappointing.",
        tagline: "A prequel no one asked for and even fewer will remember.",
        content: "For some reason despite the outstanding 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the solidly mediocre 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory someone somewhere decided it was time for the Willy Wonka origin story no one asked for.\n\nStaring the androgynous, pixie-sized, youthful Timothée Chalamet as the titular Willy is a strange choice. He lacks the chaotic unsettling energy Depp brought to the role, let alone anything close to what Gene Wilder generated on screen.\n\nIn our first introduction to Wonka, he's a frighteningly naive, stupid child who is also generous and well-intentioned. A very different characterisation to other films where he is a near Loki-like character, a tricker with a gleam of malevolence. He won't hurt you, but he'll do a lot of things to tempt you to hurt yourself.\n\nHis ragged outfit which is a little large is very much the Artful Dodger,(even more so when he adopts his sidekick), making him seem very young. We're told Wonka's been on a sea voyage for 7 years. Chalamet's presence and performance make him perhaps 18, so he was a very young sailor. Or he's Chalamet's real age of nearly 30. Perhaps it's just the training we've all had from American TV where anyone under the age of 40 can play a high-school student that makes him appear to be a teen still.\n\nChalamet's American accent seems extremely out of place as a master chocolatier given America's terrible track record when it comes to chocolate. The extravagance of his creations is rather American, but people insist the chocolate also tastes good, so we must assume Wonka, like Chalamet is, at least half, French.\n\nThere's a huge influence from The Greatest Showman in this film's look. As well as Harry Potter. The opening of his store could easily be swapped with the Weasly Twin's store.\n\nChalamet is consistently aiming for Wilder or Depp in his performance but all I can see is Reese from Malcolm in the Middle. His outbursts are not terrifying or insane they are petulant. I think the issue is, without his Factory, without the environment of magic, wonder and danger he has created, everything Wonka says and does in the grimy London that surrounds him comes across as deranged rather than enchanting.\n\nIn a bizarre nod to the Depp film filmed in Munich and using a lot of local extras, the police are dressed in faux-German WW1 outfits rather than the British Bobbies you'd expect and certain names are very Germanic. Quite nicely, the three rival chocolatiers who confront Wonka in his red velvet code are dressed in primary colours, looking from above like they are a Roses Selection.\n\nWonka rescues a young black girl from a life of slavery. It's played for laughs. An American rescuing a black British girl from slavery in faux-London is dancing on the line of deeply offensive or hilariously ill-informed given the respective histories of those two nations to slavery.\n\nNoodle & Wonka sing a silly song whilst milking a Giraffe. Chalamet's voice is a pretty high key, Alto perhaps and Noodle's is higher, which makes the duet a little shrill. The music is lazy. Rather than creating rhymes, they lean heavily on just creating words. Moodle to rhyme with Noodle. This is a pretty consistent problem throughout the movie.\n\nThe wonder and needed nonsense ramps up finally when they decide to break into the cathedral of the chocoholic monks and the corrupt priest, it's just a shame this is right at the end. If I looked as young as Chalamet, I'd not be willing to sneak into a Catholic Church. Rowan Atkinson is, naturally, outstanding as the priest.\n\nThe drug cartel metaphor is both heavy-handed and lacking in execution. Which is an impressive fumble. Keegan-Michael Key does what he can with his growing addiction but it's also played straight for laughs.\n\nThe reveal is trite and predictable. The Death by Chocolate scene lacks impact given the fact Wonka later successfully uses exactly this sort of deranged approach to dealing with people he dislikes.\n\nChalamet attempts a touching rendition of Pure Imagination, but he misses the mark. Take a watch of the better version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVi3-PrQ0pY&ab_channel=beralts\n\nIt's unclear how Charlie later walks by this distant ruined castle on a daily basis.\n\nThe film was mediocre, which given how good many of the cast are is a little unforgivable. My footnote would be that Chalamet wasn't the actor for this role, he's not got the maniacal presence to bring the edge that Wonka needs. A stronger Wonka would have brought something this film desperately needed.",

Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan brings a nerdy enthusiasm that's as refreshing as finding an untouched slice of pizza the morning after a party. Monica's superhero landing needs work, and the Skrull sympathy play feels like trying to hug a cactus. The CGI swings from \"meh\" to \"passable,\" with a side of cat-rescue missions that make you question your life choices. Clocking in at a merciful 1h45m, \"The Marvels\" manages to entertain without needing to pause for a bathroom break, but it's more of a microwave dinner than a feast for the senses.",
        tagline: "Higher. Further. Faster.",
        content: "Iman carries the movie, her sheer enthusiasm shines through every scene. Her near stalker level insanity when talking to Captain Marvel is somehow endearing. \"I'm on a team with Captain Maaaaarveeeeel!!!\" Kamala's mum tells her 'no space adventures!' whilst she herself is in space is ace and very on brand for the character.\n\nIman is just a Ms. Marvel variant from Earth-1218, she's not acting, this is who she is.\n\nLooking at Kamala's face when she utters \"Oh captain, my captain!\" It's likely that Kamala's got some difficult conversations coming with her more conservative family members.\n\nThe absolute chaos of the first fight is fantastic.\n\nMonica being kinda useless in an emergency, or in space, or on an alien world; whether that's saving Kamala from falling to her death, noticing when Kamala wandered off to be heroic or ignoring Carol when she says not to do anything on the musical world (Side note, Kamala just vibing along in the background is awesome) is great as she's a scientist, not a soldier or a superhero. Normally we get a near-instant transition from people getting powers to them being incredible superheroes.\n\nIt remains hard to side with the Skrulls. I've got too much 616 bias to them. Bring in Reed and let them turn them into cows. This batch are incredibly whiney and self-righteous. Luckily we have very little exposure to them.\n\nKing Valkryie is great, but it really highlights how few good female characters Marvel actually put out that a bit-part character from a Thor film has become one of the bigger names. Don't get me wrong, Tessa Thompson is fantastic each time she's on screen, but the character's not a major player in the mainline Avengers or Thor canon. It's also a bit of a slap in the face how quickly they solve the Skrull housing issue given in Secret Invasion they spent years trying and failing for some reason.\n\nMonica is at least a black woman and Kamala is asian, entirely the wrong ethnicisty, but the continent is right I guess.\n\nI love that it's a Quantum Band, tying the Marvels back to Mah-Vel and Rick Jones. (Kamala insisting on calling it a bangle is funny as it really undercuts the seriousness when they demand it.) They spend a bit too much time talking about the science of this. And deciding that an inhabited planet is the best place for water when comets exist is a little daft. Or you know they have FTL, they've probably figured out how to combine a little hydrogen and oxygen. I know there's a reason, but it's a bad reason. They should separate revenge from survival and pursue them separately.\n\nThe 'training' montage to Intergalactic is great and it's nice seeing Kamala's enthusiasm infecting two typically stoic and dour characters. It also entertainingly shows Carol's agism, in that she chooses the adult with no experience and who's an amateur with their powers to prioritise on mission instead of the youth who's been a hero professionally and knows what to do.\n\nWhat's with hyper-advanced cultures using primitive weapons with a bit of added energy? The Wakandans do it, the singing people do it, the Kree do it...\n\nCarol's absolute lack of anything resembling subtlety in a fight is good, she's typically massively more powerful than anything around her, so a smash and bash is a rational approach, she's never had to learn more.\n\nThe cat-based rescue is stupid. The only saving grace is Kamala being made to do the collecting and being basically in tears about it. We never get an explanation as to why the scientists in Fury's space station are wearing Future Foundation jumpsuits.\n\nThe film is a fairly tight 1h45 minutes, which is great, we've been dealing with epic-length films for so long it's nice to find one that's keeping a good pace. The CGI isn't anything to write home about, but it's not as bad as some Marvel properties have been lately. They've also given Carol a bit more of an aligned look to the other two's powers and toned down the Dragonball Z from her first appearance.\n\nKamala recruiting Kate is great, we knew the Young Avengers was coming, but the fact she uses Fury's lines almost exactly means at some point Tony leaked the entire conversation publically, as no one else was there to hear it.\n\nThe Binary and Beast stinger is good for what it represents, but Beast's CGI is really bad and its not ideal this is the third variant we've seen of Monica's mother, it's a shame she was used in Doctor Strange as it would make the reveal hit harder if she wasnt.",

        content: "I'm going in with the lowest of expectations, but the appearance of a Minion was somehow even worse than I imagined. But the 16-bit Nintendo opening was super cute. Already I suspect there is tension between the fantastic character-loving Nintendo and the entirely soulless Disney machine.\n\nThe animation is not great. It's not awful, but I've played video games with better renders. They have a general softness to them that is reminiscent of Muppets and that makes me sad because the Muppets doing Super Mario Bros would be a far far better film.\n\nThe cast is almost entirely pudgy white men with scraggly beards known for being wacky. We have Jack Black, Chris Pratt, Charlie Day and Seth Rogan, as well as Keegan-Michael Key and Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach. Despite all these people being talented actors (to varying degrees) none of them are voice actors. It's particularly obvious with Day (Luigi) & Pratt (Mario) who do the Italian accents the plumbers are known for a grand total of 20 seconds for a deliberately cringe-inducing TV advert for their plumbing business. Given how many Americans there are who've never been to Italy, have no immediate family from Italy but do proudly claim to be Italian, you'd think they'd find one or two who could manage a credible accent. Particularly as we get a brief meal with their family who are straight out of the Sopranos, so we wonder how they lost their accents, but also developed two different accents despite spending all their time together.\n\nThe big reveal of the Mushroom Kingdom isn't dramatic enough, the colours and vibe of New York were still cartoony and bright. Dry Bones is pretty good though, and the scene of them chasing Luigi has some tension.\n\nThe antique store with the sign written with visible pixels is fab.\n\nPeach's raised thrown under a massive stained glass picture of herself is fantastic and so entirely on brand for her narcissism. She's also a master of unarmed combat and parkour. The scene where she does the training run is basically identical but worse than when we met Princess Fiona. We also get 'holding out for a hero' used less well than Shrek did. We get a scene reminiscent of the Muffin Man torture. Basically what I'm saying is, if you have the option, go watch Shrek again.\n\nBowser sits closer to his subject, throws heavy rock concerts for them, and talks to them directly. He appears to be a better ruler than Peach. He does kill one for questioning him, but as he's immediately Undead, it's fine I guess? His creepy obsession with marrying Peach is horrifying as we are very aware of what 'marry' means in this context, but it's played for laughs.\n\nMario gets really good at everything really fast. But really, he learns the power of friendship. But also relying on himself. And Naruto running. That's important too.\n\nMario gets picked on and degraded by his father at the start of the film, and Luigi is ignored. In the end, his father says \"You were amazing Mario\" and continues to ignore Luigi who was just as incredible. Mario may get closure, but Luigi remains Player 2.\n\nGiven the soundtrack of 80's hits, I wonder if Chris Pratt insisted given on how well it went for his breakout film.\n\nThe best character by far is the cheery, insane, blue flame, captured in a cage. 'There's no sunshine, only Darkness!'\n\nKids will enjoy it, it's loud and colourful and recognisable. It will no doubt sell the various spin-off games that are definitely coming but as a film. it's much less a film and more a 90-minute advert for Ninendo's Mario franchise. We get the platformer, Mario Kart (complete with the drift boost), a nod to Luigi's Mansion, Donkey Kong...",

        content: "The director wanted authenticity, and there are elements of this throughout, but none more than the fact the whole film was also shot in Comanche in parallel.\n\nWe meet our protagonist, Naru. She's got intricate eye makeup and is practising throwing an axe into a tree with her dog. (the dogs nearby it's not helping with the target practice) Then she spots a deer track and follows it, but a noise startles the deer, and she chases it through the forest with some parkour, her dog doing some solid herding until it's trapped by a steel trap, that she unfastens easily.\n\nShe tries to figure the trap out and half-heartedly bashes it with a rock, then wanders off after healing her dog with some magic dirt. Coco, the canine actor, is not a trained actor at all, as the director wanted authenticity, and so the breed is one from this history of Native American tribes. It's quite nice seeing a dog be a dog wandering off camera a bit and grinning rather than a perfect robot. However, it can be a little jarring when the cast is going for seriousness, and the pup is leaping up to play.\n\nWe're introduced to the Predator early, in its camo armour, with its ship flying off. We're expected to know from our meta experience that the Predator is here to hunt the most dangerous game in the universe. Humans!\n\nNaru wants to be a hunter, like the men of the tribe, and her brother supports her (somewhat) due to her tracking skills, though our evidence of this was spotting massive hoofprints and a deer two meters away, so maybe this tribe's bar is just really low?\n\nAll the hunters hold their bowstrings strangely; given the insistence on canine accuracy, I assume this is also how Native Americans used their bows, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe hunters are hunting a lion, not realising they intern are being hunted by a Predator! Perhaps, soon, the hunter will become the hunted? Does the predator become the Prey? The obvious play on words becomes explicit, perhaps?\n\nThe landscapes are just gorgeous.\n\nThe lion in the dark is primal and scary. Naru's knocked unconscious escaping, but her brother staggers back to the fire with the lion's head and blood all over his face. It's taxed him to the limit. High on his success he boldly announces he can defeat anything out there and crushes his sister's dreams of joining the Hunters as she tried but had to be carried back and couldn't bring it home. It's impossible not to think of how this conversation will play out in reverse with the Predator. Or how much he has done exactly what the Predator is on Earth to do.\n\nWe get a grizzly ready to eat Naru, and her dog uses himself as bait to lure the bear off, He's a good dog! Trapped in a beaver dam with its teeth inches away from her all goes quiet until the bear and Predator fight it's a good tense scene and it's not clear the Predator is going to win (Which would be a hilarious end to the film) until he does and holding the carcass above himself, the predator gets revealed in true invisible man style by getting covered in blood.\n\nYou cannot fault the bravery of the Hunters, they see the Predator's face, see it shrug off an arrow or two and still attach. You can fault their intelligence. Naru legs it after she sees it slaughter basically everyone she knows. She's smarter than they were.\n\nWe meet the owners of the bear trap. Do you remember that from the start, the other bit of anachronistic tech and the only thing that really gave us a clue when this was taking place? They're scumbag French Trappers who use Naru & her brother as bait. Don't get attached.\n\nNaru's the only one thinking about how the Predator is behaving and what that means, but the Trappers do a pretty good job of knocking it down and getting a net over it. Then things fall apart for them. One of the trappers back away when the odd little box starts bleeping. The others get closer. Naru has left by this point to rescue her dog from the rest of the Trappers. She saves the Predator a trip by killing them all herself.\n\nPredator isn't doing so great, he's sealing himself back up where he's been cut and stabbed.\n\nPredator stamps on a wounded captive of the French and then stabs him when he screams, it's not very on brand given he's not typically targeting non-threats.\n\nThe wirework for her brother arriving is terrible, which is a shame as the action to this points been really good, but he makes up for it in the close combat. Her brother knows that means he's not going any further. He tells his sister, \"Bring it Home\" and distracts Predator for her to vanish.\n\nShe tricks the Predator by arming one of the remaining trappers with a powderless gun, and he goes in for the kill, shoots him in the back of the head and grabs his mask. It's pretty great, but she is just standing there with the gun, and whilst I get the message of underestimating women, it seems unlikely an Alien hunter species would do that given it's a peculiarity of Humanity sociology.\n\nPredator no longer takes her as non-threatening, and is doing a pretty good job of beating her up, though she takes his arm off.\n\nCoco saves the day. Bringing her her trusty axe, Naru uses its cord to pull him into the quicksand she fell into earlier. The rise from the mud is pretty tense. Then we discover this Predator is a card-carrying half-wit as he forgot the targeting device was on his helmet and she set that up, pointing at him. It's really nicely done but does require the Predator to be carrying the idiot ball for it to work.\n\nShe returns to her tribe, covered in glowing green blood and carrying a dismembered Predators head. They take her seriously that maybe they should move on.\n\nIts a solid horror/action movie; Naru carries the entire film, and almost everyone else is forgettable. Almost everyone but Coco.",

        tagline: "On the anniversary of Wes Anderson's birthday and prompted by an ongoing TikTok theme of 'X in the style of Wes Anderson we got together to watch one of his most famous films, the Royal Tannenbaums.",
        content: "One of the most obvious notes, coming off the TikTok trends is this film is not Wes as a parody of himself as he arguably becomes with his most recent films. The combination of his signature style and budget means he has had a tendency to over-emphasise the symmetry and pastel shades he's known for. Whilst these things are present in Royal Tannenbaums, they are not overpowering, but rather a subtle thread woven through.\n\nSet in a New York that seems permanently constrained to the 1970s, the film follows a famous New York family, royalty in the way America does royalty, through celebrity which becomes notoriety over time, as opposed to the UK's more traditional approach of selecting a single family and ensuring the only marry their cousins until inbreeding brings drama faster than their chins disappear.\n\nThe three children are all prodigies of a sort, a playwright, a tennis star and a genius for business. Each brings the personal peculiarity you expected from Anderson to the table and as we meet them again in late adulthood their eccentricity has become complete dysfunction. The fourth child, a neighbour follows their path to dysfunction, but as a side character lacks the immunity from the consequences a family of American Royalty has.\n\nThe cast is outstanding, Paltrow before she went completely off the deep end of steamed vaginas and alkaline water with acidic lemon and bone broth, both Wilson brothers, Stiller in one of his rare non-comedic roles he should do more of, Gene Hackman channelling his Luthor and the best Morticia Addams we've ever had Anjelica Huston.\n\nThe case and script do big emotions, played small. The whole thing is very WASP and big on awkwardness, so much so, it sometimes feels British in the unlikableness of the characters.\n\nArrested Development is if the Royal Tannenbaums was filmed by cops - Jason bateman\nAnderson plays with abrupt cuts, making the transitions jarring and sudden, a visible difference from the common smoothing we often see in feature films.\n\nIt's mild and silly as a film until it isn't, an approach Anderson describes as very much his style, perhaps more than the symmetry and pastel colours, is the sudden shift from the quiet to the loud. Richie's suicide attempt comes almost from nowhere, we're conditioned to see a dramatic haircut as both cathartic and cleansing and we assume we know where things are going because we see so little of the real emotions of the characters around us, repressed and hidden, they suddenly rise to the surface and in a red river flow to the drain.\n\nThe callousness of the Tannenbaums for those not 'of them' is evident in the waiting room, the boy who is the subject of psychological evaluation and experimentation is left to sit in his bloody t-shirt after finding Richie. No one thinks to engage or offer him new clothing.\n\nRichie leaves the hospital and finds his adoptive sister in his childhood tent, there is poignance and hopelessness in his childhood tent. they acknowledge their shared feelings and their shared sense nothing can happen, despite there being no real reason other than their perception to the constraints they feel.\n\nAfter a dramatic car crash, where Stiller's children are just barely saved from death by Hackman, there is an off-beat Monty Python chase through the hotel. In a tiny nod to Stiller's ongoing references to his workouts, he easily vaults a wall that later a soldier struggles to even scale.\n\nOne of Anserson's more grounded films, it's a very strong story of a family that fell apart years before they admitted it, who spent a decade or two going through the motions, without ever going beneath the surface.\n\nOther Thoughts\nColour-matching Ambilights add a lot to a Wes Anderson film given his use of colour and saturation.\n\nWhen you close your eyes, it's impossible to tell if it's Luke or Owen speaking.",

The reviewer found some parts of the movie funny, but it may not be the best choice for someone looking for a serious or coherent film. This score indicates that the movie is somewhat entertaining but may not be universally appealing or particularly memorable.",
        tagline: "It's a movie about a bear doing cocaine and it's based on \"True Events\". This may be all the review you need. p.s. I found it funny.",
        content: "We get some advice on surviving a black bear attack set against clouding landscape shots and sporadic plinks of notes. They then tell us this vital information on survival is from Wikipedia.\n\nTwo hippies are camping out, rather he's German (ish, American film accents are hit or miss) and a hippie and she's his fiance along for the ride. he's lecturing about how exactly is a state, not a drug. She might be German, but the actress definitely isn't. ( googled and she's Dutch)\n\nThey step over a massive bear footprint. Honestly, it has a puddle of water in it, it's bigger than the one in Jurassic Park. This bear better be 5 meters tall.\n\nThe fiance says \"I've always wanted to see a bear in real life, we have such good luck in nature.\" and they take photos of it. He's a bit more sensible.\n\nHe says 'Fight it!' she says 'Fuck that for a game of soldiers you daft bugger\" and legs it. Remender kids, you don't need to be faster than a bear, you need to be faster than your fiance, She was! Except he fell over and the bear just leap over him and ate her. He gets to keep her leg though as a present.\n\nCOCAINE BEAR!\n\nIt chases a poorly CGI'd butterfly and ignores the German guy.\n\nWoah! I feel old now, we get a few anti-drug commercials from my youth.\n\nWe basically get a bunch of groups of people, loosely connected. So I'm going to tell you about them separately.\n\nSyd\nWe meet Syd, the big bad drug dealer who lost the coke. He looks kinda like a bear himself. Turns out his son was involved in the 'business' and his daughter-in-law Joan is dead. He feels teh son in law should be a)over it and b)back on drugs by now. Charming fellow. He's looking after his grandson and is kinda sick of it. He sends his, we assume, right-hand man to bring his son-in-law back into the fold.\n\nSyd's played by Ray Liotta. I assumed he was dead.\n\nSyd kinda turns up near the end with a rifle and shoots the police officer. In the time between shooting the officer and going to investigate the officers gave all 14,000,000 USD of coke to the bear.\n\nTurns out his partner Reba was on the take. It would be a bigger emotional reveal if we got more than 30 seconds with her at the start. She was so inconsequential this is the first you heard of her after all.\n\nSyd's the only one left in the cave, not wanting to get his coke wet. He gets strangled by the bag he refused to leave behind by the bear. It's supposed to be deep. it's deeply stupid.\n\nRanger Liz, Peter and Sari\nYou'll know the actress, Margo Martindale, she's been in a lot. To the point Bojack Horseman makes fun of it.\n\nShe chats to a hiker in very 70's gear who does a bit of mild shoplifting but wins her over with some flattery about her perfume. The reason for her wearing the perfume arrives with a cardboard Smokie the Bear, basically oblivious to the romantic interest of the Ranger. Peter's played by the guy who played Mitchell in Modern Family.\n\nA concerned woman, Sari, arrives looking for her daughter. The ranger, the gent and her head out. The ranger oversells us on the danger of the local gang. the Doochamps.\n\nThey spot Henry up a tree, DeeDee is nowhere to be found.\n\nPeter doesn't like to call animals animals, he calls them friends. Shortly after this reveal, he gets mauled, a little. The Ranger also gets a little mauled. They all climb trees. Peter remarks that of course bears can climb trees. They all wonder why they are up there.\n\nI think we're supposed to find this bit tense and nerve-racking. But everyone has been so annoying so far, and the bear has been so ineffective at attacking Americans that we're really not worried. The bear ignores Sari and climbs up after Henry. Peter pats all the cocaine off himself for some stupid reason and gets eaten due to the delicious cocaine aroma.\n\nOr rather his leg gets eaten off. Same as the German woman. That's really unpleasant, but I'm not sure it's instantly fatal like it seems to be.\n\nDoochamps\nThe Doochamps are a trio of incredibly sleazy, scrawny and ineffective muggers. One was the shoplifter who talked to the ranger. They decide to mug our huge drug dealer Davdeed, who's decked out in gold and is clearly massive. It goes exactly as well for them as you expect. They get the ever-loving shit kicked out of them. He gets a bit stabbed, but not seriously. The Doochamps have found at least one parcel of coke. Eddie and Daveed interrogate one of them and take him off to get the rest of the coke they buried.\n\nThe two remaining Doochamps decide to re-rob the ranger station despite being walking bruises. They get caught doing it by the Ranger. They see a bear outside, sat all cute. The Ranger accidentally kills one of the Doochamps, the other one is covered in his brain. The bear just kinda leaves. Then comes back to maul the face of a Doochamp.\n\nDetective Bob Springs\nThe stereotyped black police Detective ended up with a fancy dog when he wanted a man's best friend type, it felt a bit scattergun in their attempts to make all these people interesting and quirky.\n\nHe arrives after some of the groups have already been mauled and/or maimed. But somehow misses everything. He finds the gazebo a long time before everyone else and sees the bag that's been stashed.\n\nThey really really want him to say \"I'm too old for this shit\" but can't quite get him to. He gets the drop on Daveed from his position on top of the Gazebo and later shoots Daveed (and shoots off two of his fingers) when Daveed tries to grab his gun back.\n\nThe bear shows up, whilst he's still on the Gazeebo roof. After an altercation with Eddie, he's the only smart one and uses the coke to lure the bear away. But there is a standoff between him and Daveed, a standoff ended by Syd's rifle.\n\nHe at least gets a chuckle when Syd's crew all head off towards \"an Apex Predator, high on cocaine\"\n\nEddie & Daveed\nSyd's son, Eddie is sad and got a tattoo to commemorate his wife, but the tattooist was illiterate and wrote John. He's depressed. even his Penne (weirdly pronounced Peneeee) is plain. Daveed draggs him out of his depressed bar funk and into a depressed car funk. He and Daveed are driving through the countryside, listening to Wings of Love, which is making Eddie cry again. He thinks Syd might have killed his wife. Via giving her cancer. It's stupid.\n\nEddie & Daveed, after capturing a Doochamp, make him take them to where he buried the rest of the coke. Daveed wants to just get this shit done with. Eddie and the Doochamp decide to play 20 questions. I'd have smacked them both.\n\nWe get a great dream scene where the one remaining Doochamp imagines he and his crew are moving to NY City. One is holding his head in his arms. The others were covered in blood. Eddit and the Doochamp hug. They're too late too get the drugs.\n\nDuring the bear's appearance at the gazebo, it collapses unconscious on top of Eddie. They think it might be dead. It isn't. For some reason Daveed puts his ear to it, rather than, shooting it through the eye. The bear manages to eat the entire parcel of coke instead of bothering them, then molests Eddie a bit.\n\nAfter his arrival and somewhat forcible recruitment of them both, Syd drags them into the bear's cave, and they gather up the remaining coke. Reba leaves as Syd's wants to keep exploring the park to find more coke. I assume Syd's one of those 100% completionists in video games too.\n\nSyd gets harassed by the bear cubs and accidentally throws his gun to Sari. They use that as a way to escape and jump off Chekov's cliff.\n\nReba gives the Detective's dog to Eddie. It seems to solve all his emotional issues. The dog eats Daveeds missing fingers.\n\nHenry & DeeDee\nTwo young kids are out hiking. I'm 90% sure this is the start of a Stephen King book. One carrying a rifle. This being America it may be an actual rifle or a BB Gun. Impossible to tell. They find a parcel of coke. Luckily they've been paying attention to the anti-drug lectures and so they immediately recognise it. Henry bullshits his way about having done coke before. The girl tells him to do it again, and they entirely cut the bag open. She then takes a full-on mouthful of the powder, and so does he. They also find a half-empty packet. They think its a deer. We know its a guy in a bear suit. Wait, sorry, no, a scary bear that they definitely had the budget to have in every scene.\n\nWhen they do give you a full visual of the bear it's pretty good, all foamy faced. It sneezes on the kids and they run away.\n\nDuring his wandering with Sari, they find the German hiker, Olaf. He's sitting out crying about his wife. Henry helps himself to some food.\n\nSari's finds the bear's lair with the help of Olaf who waits outside, gifting them a small flashlight. She brings Henry with her. I think this woman's an idiot. Inside the cave DeeDee's just been hanging out with a few baby bears who are so covered in coke they \"look like polar bears\" We get the most insanely huge cliff and waterfall. It's Chekov's waterfall. Saying it now.\n\nAnd it was. Sar, DeeDee, Henry, Daveed and Eddie all leap safely into the water from this huge cliff and escape.\n\nThe Ambulance Crew!\nThe ambulance people arrive and try and deal with all the blood and fatalities. it does not go well for them, it's comical rather than terrible. The two ambulance people and Ranger Liz manage to get in the ambulance and drive away.\n\nThe bear chases the ambulance, catches it, even with Liz shooting at it, and eats the male Ambulance drives hand, the driver panics hits a tree and flies through the windscreen. it's hilarious!\n\nPost Credits:\nThe dog eats Daveeds fingers\n\nThe Doochamp kid, Stache, who survived managed to get the duffle full of coke. he hitches a lift with a farmer and his sheep. Stache changes his mind about leaving the coke in the back with the animals.\n\nFinal thoughts\nA much better real-life (ish) film of the crazy white people getting eaten by bears is Grizzly Man by Werner Hertzog. But that's serious rather than funny. If you've got 90 minutes to kill and you want to turn your brain off, give it a go.",

        aiSummary: "\"The Whale\" is a cinematic journey that's as intimate as it is uncomfortable. It's a claustrophobic exploration of self-loathing, redemption, and the human capacity for both cruelty and kindness. Brendan Fraser delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Charlie, a man trapped in his own body and his own guilt. The supporting cast, particularly Sadie Sink and Hong Chau, bring depth and emotional resonance to this tragic tale. It's not an easy watch, but it's a powerful one that will leave you pondering long after the credits roll.",
        tagline: "A- Go watch it. Though seeing Charlie's life, I doubt you'll be able to make yourself eat all the snacks you've brought for the film's duration.",
        content: "First shot, grainy 4:3 of a bus stop in the middle of a flyover state. Darren Aronofsky really wanted that Oscar.\n\nFollowed by a slow zoom on a Zoom call's black screen for our protagonist, Charlie, teaching a class on writing and explaining his camera is still broken.\n\nWe then get to watch him nearly have a heart attack whilst pleasuring himself to soft-core gay porn. A convenient knock at the door leads to a young Mormon being roped into saving him by reading an essay about Moby Dick. The Mormon's only question, aside from \"Can I call you an Ambulance\" is \"Why did you want me to read that essay to you\" It's a fair question.\n\nHis nurse, Liz who he calls his friend, comes round to see how he's doing. The Mormon's still there reading the Good Book in a corner of the room. He wants to leave but also doesn't want to seem like a bad person to himself. The actor does a solid job here in silence.\n\nThe nurse and Mormon discuss the end of the world, the nurse sees the darkness and suffering, and the religious boy has hope of beauty. It's a tad on the nose.\n\nLiz and Charlie rush wildly through anger and apology and a few laughs. It's clear they've had conversations like this before and the speed is from a well-worn path, not a poor script. She knew his late boyfriend and what happened and their history is shared trauma from the Mormon church. It's later we find out their shared trauma is a shared suicide. Her brother and his boyfriend, are driven to end it by the pressures of his homophobic priest father.\n\nCharlie eats a bucket of fried chicken whilst she leans her head on him and watches TV. Given how unclean he and his apartment are, I'm not sure I'd put my head anywhere nearby.\n\nCharlie once again reads the same passages of the essay. After a sentence or two, he puts it down but continues narrating. Shirtless, he talks about the \"White Whale\" and how it has no emotions and is a poor big animal as he moves through the apartment, his body so much like the whale. It's honestly better done than it sounds, as writing it, it comes across as ham-fisted.\n\nThis is not a film supporting HAES, Charlie works his way through a sizable drawer full of snacks as he alternates between grading papers and reading about his heart disease. Despite his size and constraints, he showers and shaves. He's not quite given up on himself, but he is too ashamed to be seen by others except his one friend.\n\nCharlie feeds a bird with small sliced fruit. We don't see the bird.\n\nHis daughter, Ellie, answers his request to visit. It's obviously been a while since she asks \"Does this mean I'll get fat?\" She's cold, distant, and angry, she tells him to her face that he's disgusting and it's not his weight, it's his student-fucking ways.\n\nCharlie offers Ellie a way to graduate, he'll pay her $120,000 to stay and spend time with him and he'll help her pass her classes. It's sad, painful, and desperate. Frasier really sells it, you know he has felt it himself. Ellie is brutal to him. Understandably but unpleasantly. She makes him walk unaided. She doesn't blink or flinch as he collapses. The door closes and the apartment darkens.\n\nCharlie has a routine with the Pizza Guy, he leaves money in the mailbox and they leave multiple large pizzas on the ground. But this time the guy asks if he's ok. Charlie's voice has a catch to it when he says he's fine. \"thank you\" contains the sum of his surprise and appreciation for that moment of real human care.\n\nLiz is not happy his daughter is back in his life, and even more unhappy Charlie almost dies choking on his food. She cares so much for him, but you can see her fraying at the edges as he no longer cares for himself.\n\nEllie never forgets anything, and she is ruthless in her questioning. In many ways, she's serving as Charlie's own subconscious. He can't forgive himself for his own actions and he can't stand himself.\n\nThe Mormon, Thomas, returns and is entirely unable to deal with Ellie, it's fun! Their scenes together are pure chaos energy as the threatens him and flirts with him. Ellie threatens to murder her father if he doesn't do a hit of weed with her. He used to be a serial stoner. She compulsively shoots photos of him and interrogates him. She negs him over and over. It's rare I'm on the side of a doomsday cultist missionary, but I feel bad for him.\n\nTurns out he's not a Mormon (he was in the stage play, but they've made him more generic for film) he's a member of the New Life cult, who also believe god will save 144,000 people just like the Mormons, but they're different. She's sort of flirting with him in an aggressive, offputting way. The not-Mormon decides to lecture Charlie, he calls it 'saving'. Charlie much better read and far too full of self-loathing to listen. The definitely not Mormon missionary considers this a mystical calling due to the coincidence. Liz lays into him, saying he's only got a few days left and only she could save him.\n\nWe're an hour in and it went by without really noticing. Not much is happening, but it's not much happening with gravity to it. The scenes have a weight to them.\n\nEllie reacts, as many teenagers do, with frustration and embarrassment when it becomes clear he cares for her and thinks highly of her. But it's clear it touched her. She angrily makes him a sandwich, telling him it will be a small one and no mayo.\n\nTurns out Thomas has been lying, and Ellie knew. He's not from New Life, he was sent to preach but ended up standing on street corners giving out pamphlets. Thomas was underwhelmed by this. Thomas is locked in a dark room, talking through the door to Ellie, she's lit from above, and he's half in darkness. The camera slowly creeps in on him as he tells us how he left the mission taking the petty cash with him.\n\nEllie's not just listening, she's recording. It feels like a betrayal. Thomas finds Alan's (the brother/lover) bible and leafs through it. He nearly finds her recording, but she turns it into taking a photo.\n\nLiz has called Mary, the ex-wife. She comes in like a wrecking ball. Telling Liz about the six figures in Charlie's account, despite him having no health insurance, any of the support he needs, and her having to walk through the snow with his groceries as her truck had broken down. Mary, in a heart-to-heart with Charlie, finds out a little about his life, and shares hers then tells him their daughter is 'evil' and proves it with her social media where she's posting pictures of him with captions like \"There will be a grease fire in hell when he does\". He tries, as he keeps trying to do, to be positive about it, but she screams at him for just not listening.\n\nThey move through emotions as only close friends or family can. leaping from the peaks of anger to the depths of sadness. If Frasier won Best Actor, it's as much because of the performances of those around him giving him everything he needs to respond.\n\nMary puts her head on his chest to listen to his heart, mirroring Liz's pose earlier when they watched TV. Charlie's hand hovers in the air, uncertain if he could lay it on her shoulder.\n\nDan's waiting in the rain to see what the mysterious Charlie looks like after picking up his pizza. He then runs off, Charlie assuming it's because he is disgusted by the sight. More likely because he's embarrassed to be caught.\n\nCharlie demands \"WRITE ME SOMETHING FUCKING GOOD\" in a message to his students, and then in a deeply uncomfortable scene, crams food into his face, with no care or constraint, his mouth and clothes stained with the residue until he's finally sick and weeping.\n\nThomas returns, confessing his lies and that Ellie had shared all his secrets to the world. He's hopeful that her brutality was a brutal honesty, not a cruelly. His parents have told him he's forgiven and can return. Thomas then tells him that Alan died because he chose Charlie, not God. It's tone-deaf, patronising, and offensive in the way only the truly passionately religious can be.\n\nCharlie gives a litany of his physical problems, pushing at Thomas until Thomas admits he finds him disgusting. The answer Charlie feared but also wanted.\n\nHe's been removed from teaching the class, but in his final lesson, he turns on the camera so they can see him. The horror and disgust on their faces exist in a time earlier than when we are seeing this play. Charlie's huge, but the rise of a wider group of body positivity influencers across media means he's not so shockingly obese that it would cause such surprise in middle America. Like his interpretation of Dan's reaction, we are left to wonder how much is Charlie's own self-hatred rather than the hatred of others.\n\nCharlie smashes his laptop when he finishes the call.\n\nAlan was dying of an eating disorder, he refused to eat.\n\nLiz, having spent the film trying over and over again to help Charlie, and we find out, having done the same with Alan, tells Charlie \"I don't believe anyone can save anyone\" Charlie takes comfort in his interpretation of how Ellie behaved to Thomas, that she did help him.\n\nCharlie tells Liz \"People are Amazing\"\n\nThe Moby Dick essay was one Ellie wrote when she was a child, he gave it to her instead of the one he had promised to write. She's furious. Until he tells her how he's valued that piece of writing and how sorry he is for everything. He brings her to tears.\n\nCharlie dies, but not peacefully. With Ellie reading the essay to him, she almost leaves, door open, sun on her face, but turns, tearful, stood in the doorway. Charlie tries to walk unaided across to her. the sun washing his face out to an unhealthy pale white. Step by heavy step he approaches his daughter. Unlike earlier, Ellie walks to him. She smiles through her tears.\n\nThere's a rapture moment, feel leave the ground, a scene of a child and father on the beach.\n\nand burn to white.\n\nWell, that's quite a ride.\n\nThe closeness of the 4:3, and the fact we, like Charlie, are trapped in the apartment makes the film claustrophobic. We occasionally get out, following the nurse or missionary, Charlie doesn't, he sometimes looks out, pale and overwhelmed through a door. It's almost more theatre than cinema, which is unsurprising as it is a slight rewrite by Samuel D. Hunter of Samuel D. Hunter's play.\n\nThe cast is tiny but do incredible things. Brendan Frasier, who won an oscar for his role here and deserved it. Sadie Sink from Stranger Things is raw and emotional. Ty Simpkins the missionary shows he has more range than being a 'kid' in a real movie (the boy in Iron Man 3 and the boy in Jurassic World.) and finally, Hong Chau carries the burden of carrying Charlie. Other than this there is the voice of Dan the pizza man, and Mary the ex-wife.",

        aiSummary: "The reviewer describes the movie as a fun and faithful portrayal of a D&D campaign, with plenty of nods to the source material and a lot of heart. The diverse cast of characters and the various backstories add depth and complexity to the story. The humor and slapstick elements add to the enjoyment, while the use of various D&D creatures and references will appeal to fans of the game. The reviewer does mention some minor disappointments, such as the lack of visible magic from Chris Pine's Bard and the absence of Drow in the Underdark, but overall this seems like a highly entertaining and well-crafted movie.",
        tagline: "Natural 20/10. This movie is just so much fun.",
        content: "From the random scenery changes as they travel to their consistently failing plans and slapstick escapes and their reliance on random objects to solve their problems, to the paladin with a stick up his arse, it's not just a movie set in the world of D&D, it's a movie about a D&D campaign in action. It clearly loves the source material, and has enormous fun with itself, while also having a lot of heart.\n\nWe get a long intro showcasing the danger of a character who lasts 15 seconds with our Barbarian. A wonderful scene of a Bard using charisma to stall, accidentally achieving their pardon but not discovering they had been pardoned as they'd already enacted their breakout and now are wanted again. We get a wide scattering of the races of Forgotten Realms, we see Dragonborn, Aarakocra (Squaa!), Dwarves, Elves, Tieflings, populating the Sword Coast of the Forgotten Realms.\n\nThe various tragic backstories of the Party that they all have is great.\n\nThe Paladin is every Paladin played by a player. Deliberately humourless, honourable to the point of nonsense and so rigid they walk over rocks rather than around them. It's amazing. It's a testament to the skill of the actor that the character is still charming.\n\nThe displacer beasts are fantastic. The Gelatinous Cube is awesome. The Mimic was great. The fact the first Speak with Dead fails due to accidentally using all the questions is so dead on for a D&D game with a vindictive DM that it's almost too on the nose. As an added bonus, it was great to see the party of the original D&D cartoon make an appearance in the background.\n\nOf course, Elmister turns up. Its not an adventure in the Forgotten Realms if that old meddler doesn't show his face.\n\nThe way they get people out of the arena is fantastic and I can just hear the DM saying - 'OK, give me a roll'. I've heard of Chekov's gun, but this may be the first Chekov's Balloon.\n\nIt was a little disappointing we didn't see Chris Pine's Bard do any visible magic through song though.\n\nSeems a waste to go into the Underdark and not see any Drow, but equally I can see why they decided not to do a Community 'So, we're just gonna ignore that hate crime, huh?'\n\nThe film gets +1 bonus to hit from the characters' names, like Jarnathan, and the fact that Simon had to pause when asked his surname, and then invent one on the spot because it had never come up before. And who could forget the Barbarian Holga Kilgore!",

        content: "I saw the trailer for this a while back and assumed it was a fan-made joke like the Dora The Explorer live-action Ariel Winters did. But no, someone took Winnie the Pooh entering the public domain and ran with it in all the wrong directions. Instead, they should have taken the crude script they made and had a long and serious conversation with their therapist or priest about why they wanted to make this film.\n\nWhat makes this worse is there are a small handful of just wonderful moments. To start, there is just a great set of line drawings. Reminiscent of Milne but somehow darker and clearly more disturbed.\n\nFirst minute of meeting Christopher and Mary and I'm not sure the budget stretched to trained actors.\n\n\"It's barely how I remember it\" - its been 20 years Christopher. Not much stays the same for two decades.\n\nMary is incredibly indulgent of what must seem like some fairly deep-seated mental illness from Christopher. He's insisting on introducing her to the bear, pig kangaroo etc he used to speak to as a child. She's like 'Yeah, OK, sounds legit.'\n\nShe's also the voice of reason somehow, in the very creepy woods and shacks she's constantly saying 'This is not safe' because its clearly not safe.\n\nPooh looks weirdly like Shrek, I think it's the grin. Piglet has been on the 'roids.\n\nThe cuts to white line drawings on black paper, when things get gruesome,(and they really do for little Christopher Robin) is just perfect.\n\nAfter the traumatic experience in the woods, Mary's therapist recommends she go on holiday with her friends in a house in the forest. A great idea that definitely won't further the plot.\n\nThe smart one (you know she's smart because she wears glasses) insists they all give up their phones even though the redhead hasn't arrived yet. The blonde one doesn't want to because of Instagram( because she's the blonde one so therefore the superficial one). Man, it's a real timesaver when you just use broad stereotypes instead of characters.\n\nOne of the bits they're struggling with is lacking budget, Pooh just looks like an overweight furry. Creepy yes. but also that you could outdistance him at a brisk walk before he ends up gasping for air and sitting down to have a doughnut and milkshake cuddling his waifu pillow.\n\nBut he is scary (apparently) and he isn't a furry (because he achieves goals). The poor redhead who got lost on the way to the friend's hangout got fed into a woodchipper by him and she didn't get the dignity of line drawings.I think they ran out of money to pay an illustrator with the first two.\n\nMary - \"I saw footprints in my garden. I thought i imagined it and it was probably nothing\" Those are real bits of evidence you could have photographed, plaster moulded and used to prove it wasn't in your head and you were being stalked. Maybe then you therapist wouldn't be 'Hey go hang out in the woods.'\n\nIt's pretty graphic when it wants to be. and weirdly so. The story point was they were reverting to their animal nature after Robin let them down, but what animal feeds people into a woodchipper or forces a captive to take a shower in the blood of someone else. Ok, an Orca maybe if it could.\n\n(BTW the captive is Christopher Robin, they've kept him alive for however long its been)\n\nThe blonde one is in the hot tub on her own drinking and taking 16:9 selfies, its gratuitous and it is just unhinged behaviour from someone on a group holiday with their friends given earlier she was hanging out in her room putting makeup on in her underwear dancing, also alone. She notices Pooh when she's going through the selfies and instead of turning around immediately or freaking out, she zooms in on the picture to get a closer look. 'are you stalking Maria? Whatever and wanders off' she says in a normal-speaking voice to the stalker hiding at the other end of the garden. She knows her friend is being stalked. she knows there's a weirdo in a bear mask watching her as she has a photo of him. Instead of calling the police with the phone she has in her hands or giving the stalker's victim a heads-up about the creep in the garden, she goes back in the hot tub and closes her eyes and chills out. I'm not one to victim blame, but I think on some level she just wanted to be murdered as it was better than spending time with her friends. Peak Introvert.\n\nPooh can drive a car which isnt very 'return to our animal nature' of him is it? They run her over after tying her up and hitting her with a hammer a bit. Because why the fuck not.\n\nWe're indoors again. The gang are all split up for some reason. \"Be as quiet as possible?\" one says loudly to her girlfriend (who was 100% going to break up with her after this weekend in a rare bit of character development we got earlier) \"We need to get over there to the door\" she adds unnecessarily and loudly, both of them holding weapons of some description. Then they have various other conversations instead of going out the door and leaving.\n\nSomehow even in the mask the actor playing Piglet looked as annoyed as I felt when the girl just kinda fell into the swimming pool for no reason. He swats at her ineffectively with a chain before getting his trousers wet.\n\nPooh seems to leak honey. I think they're going for him eating it messily a la the books, but mostly it looks like he dribbles over himself.\n\nSomehow one of the girls them has a gun. Which, not to be all Yankee-Doodle about it, puts then at the advantage as Pooh and Biglet walk slow and have hammers mostly.\n\nThey decide to investigate dilapidated barns rather than drive away or call the police or find a secure room with a single entrance and fortify it with their weapons and gun.\n\nThere are an extra two people they rescue. One's a complete waste of everyone's time and dies pretty much immediately and has her face eaten once it gets a nice honey glaze (and no, i'm not joking). The other is Christopher Robin who's a bit scarred but strangely buff for a guy who's been tied up and tortured for a while.\n\nOne of the brunettes captures Piglet and chains him up and tortures him. Then kills him. but all the time she wasted doing this means Pooh gets her and kills her. Unlike her, he murders when under time pressure. Remember torture is for when you are confident you have time! (Please remember this bit, This girl with a hammer easily killed Piglet by hitting him with the hammer.)\n\nThe girls steal four rednecks' car, but they don't need it as they decide to go fight Pooh. Why there are rednecks in the UK(well one is technically a bogan) is unclear. But their anger is up because unlike Pooh they are gentlemen and are offended by Pooh's misogyny. (seriously that's pretty much the reason they decide to murder this stranger. Bear in mind that had a car, they could have just left and unlike us, they don't know Pooh's a serial killer, just that these two girls are scared of him.)\n\nMock this as I have, the Rembrandt lighting on the British redneck, as he smiles working himself up to fight Pooih, was lovely. The four rednecks wail on Pooh with baseball bats, a tyre iron and a bottle. He barely notices. Unlike Piglet earlier who was killed by a single hammer strike to the head.\n\nDid I mention Pooh can summon swarms of bees? Because he can and does. I assume its a perk of being the number one honey customer in 100 Acre Wood.\n\nugh, one of my least favourite tropes. Someone climbs on the car and they weave about to shake them off rather than doing an emergency stop which would throw them over the top of the car into the road at 90 kph and you can then run them over.\n\nShe finally thinks to do it, but somehow knocks herself out and she comes too just in time to see her friend dragged out by Pooh. Goodbye smart one, you did your best.\n\nHa! he throws the smart one's head at her car window, which is just hilariously dismissive, and she uses the window wipers to get it off. This film is so stupid.\n\nPooh's about to kill her and drags her out. But surprise! (are you? I wasnt. At all, it was telegraphed for about a mile) The guy who was chained up taking blood showers that they freed chose that exact moment to arrive and hit Pooh with a car!\n\nBut it doesnt work. Pooh's fine!\n\nChristopher begs to save the girl. it also doesn't work. Pooh cuts her throat. (It was here i realised maybe this wasnt Mary as they made no comment on seeing each other again) Christopher makes zero effort to staunch the blood flow, instead hugging her and holding his forehead to hers, making this whole thing about him, which is basically what got him into this mess thinking his needs and emotions were more important than anyone else. What a way to find out you are a narcissist eh? Serial murders in front of you and a bit of light torture.\n\nThe film then stops. I say stops rather than ends because it doesn't really end, Robin's still on the road weeping and backing away, and Pooh's kinda hacking at the corpse of the girl. There's no closure, just the credits roll. Really feels like they ran out of money or battery life on the camera and shrugged assuming no one who made it this far will have noticed there is no actual ending.\n\nThe whole film could just as easily have been a Halloween or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, (and would have been better for it). The weird conceit they are the animals from 100 Acre Wood gone feral makes so little sense given they're wearing clothes, driving cars and carrying weapons.\n\np.s. turns out on reading a review, the central brunette getting over a stalker who goes to the friend gathering is Maria not Mary, so is an entirely different person than Mary who goes with Christopher Robin. Maybe some small effort in naming and character creation would have helped me not make that mistake? I'm not editing what I wrote, its too long and if the film-makers can't be bothered with making an effort, why should I?",

The dark themes and mature content may not be suitable for younger audiences, despite the film's appearance.

        tagline: "If you like Zombie Rabbits, jokes about autopsies and little wooden boys with ADHD this may be the film for you.",
        content: "Produced amazingly by the Jim Henson Company, this film is set in Mussolini's Italy and directed by Del Toro, so you know it's going to be a weird ride. It's an odd film; it looks like it's aimed at kids, but it's dark, odd, and mature.\n\nEwan McGregor narrates as Sebastian J Cricket, a pompous moustachioed traveller who once studied law and loved to sail. Not going to lie, the J makes it feel more than a little targeted... Though he does only have a moustache, not a full beard, and he is a cricket.\n\nThe puppets are beautiful, almost like china (though the stone statues are like stone), but the stop-motion seems to not be well-handled by my TV's upscaling, so things can get a bit jaggy.\n\nEveryone loves Gepetto and his son in this charming town, but in the corners of the scenes, you see the poverty and desperation from the war, isolated as they are, dogs, little more than skin and bones.\n\nNaturally, the church is huge and well-appointed, with a new masterpiece Jesus carved by Gepetto. The priest is decked in gold, watching the boy with hungry eyes.\n\nHis son dies in a pinecone and laziness-related tragedy that is very Del Toro and his sense of weirdness and pathos.\n\nDrunk and angry at a God who is not listening, Gepetto carves a boy from wood with a hole in his heart, nails in his back, and a knot for hair. It's starkly different from his other perfect carvings.\n\nThe Guardian is terrifying. Four wings, a thousand eyes, and a tail. They look after the small things. The forgotten.\n\nPinocchio stands and moves like a spider or a flailing automaton. It's fantastic. He breaks into a Disney-style song, jarring with Gepetto's terror in the background as the bizarre boy destroys his home.\n\nThe townsfolk react exactly like small townsfolk would seeing a living puppet, saying \"it's an abomination\" or \"it's a demon.\"\n\nHis nose grows like a tree branch, which is a nice touch. As is him mimicking the other boy. (Who's a right little shitbag)\n\nThere's a very evil monkey who's also apparently in charge of marketing and talent scouting (slavery), oh, and later, we find out he's a master puppeteer.\n\nThe circus master has hair like Wolverine.\n\nPinocchio is unable to understand why wooden Jesus is loved by the town, and he's hated, which is low-key hilarious.\n\nPinocchio has absolutely zero impulse control and no understanding of consequences. Pinocchio sounds like Bingo. (Circus, I'm not going to the Circus!)\n\nZombie rabbits carrying a coffin then playing cards. Somewhere Tim Burton is seething with envy.\n\nThe Sphinx is also kinda horrifying.\n\nThe autopsy is great: \"I'm afraid there is nothing that can be done. His body is already rigid!\" \"It's always been rigid; he's made of wood!\"\n\nHe finally gets a sense of consequence and takes it to the extreme, running away with the circus to save his father from poverty. Gepetto follows him, realising what he has lost.\n\nPinocchio is immortal, forever respawning but spending more time each death in the land of the dead with the Sphinx until finally, the suns burn out.\n\nThe training camp Pinocchio goes to learn to be a soldier has a giant M for its entrance. M for Mussolini.\n\nI'm not sure Del Toro intended to make training to be a fascist child soldier seem like amazing fun, but he absolutely did. There are paintball games and obstacle courses and camaraderie. There's then a whole dark execution bit, but it can't always be fun.\n\nIt's unexplained why the circus master is just hanging around the training facility ready to abduct Pinocchio when the base explodes, which he couldn't possibly be expecting.\n\nHe then crucifies him because Del Toro is nothing if not inconsistently Catholic.\n\nThe monkey saves him. Then they get eaten by a monster. But Gepetto was in there too, which is handy.\n\nI'm not sure the physics of the monster's sneeze or the branch climbing or the motor tail really holds up to scrutiny, but we'll forgive it.\n\nAfter all that, Pinocchio gets eaten again.\n\nPinocchio tries to commit suicide to save his father and friend but does a bad job at it initially, then does really well at it.\n\nThings spend a lot of time blowing up in this film.\n\nHe may or may not be immortal anymore, but he does outlive everyone he knows before re-entering the world.",

        content: "Disclaimer - I watched this at home on a regular TV, which given the only notable strength of the last film was the 3D tech, not the story which I (and everyone else) struggles to recall, this may be unfair as a review as it's going to force the story to stand on its own merits.\n\nI'm unclear why did the military, when building the combat puppets, feel the need to ensure they had full reproductive organs and that they could breed with the locals. They made them visibly demi-human due to the additional fingers and human noses for some reason. (Once they bring that up it's really hard not to notice how rarely we see the actual Naavi's hands/fingers they're hidden off camera on in a fist or otherwise in a way they don't need to worry about the finger count.) Seems a lot of extra work for something that's kind of a crime of nature and can only have negative results for humans.\n\nAnd it's low-key ableist that the main character would rather live in a swamp with working legs than be in a wheelchair in a hyper-modern setting. Am I remembering the last one wrong? Wasn't the whole thing you got to put in a chamber and controlled the blue meat suit remotely? You don't become the alien, you just basically wear a fancy costume. - After googling it, apparently, Sully transferred his brain to his meat suit form thanks to tree magic. I'm not the only one who forgot this its a common question apparently as there are about a dozen sites answering this specific question.\n\nThe main character got pretty racist pretty quick too (has he forgotten he's a human?), describing a human child as 'basically a feral cat' because the one human child on the planet wanted to play with the only four kids nearby who happen to be blue. To be fair, the kid is weirdly feral, hissing and spitting, covering himself in body paint and never washing himself, despite growing up in a hyper-science lab with scientists all around him and none of the Naavi are animalistic. It's weird and it's weird no one felt it should be addressed with some parenting. But then Sully insists his children call him \"Sir\" which is a terrifying mandate. They're his children not his subordinates so maybe he liked having a near-rabid child around due to just being a bit off-kilter himself.\n\n\"The Sky people have returned\" dude, have your brains turned to mush? You know they're humans, you know the name of the company they work for and you're not telling anyone else, you are narrating to us. God, Sully's such a poseur. I'm shocked he's not grown a beard and wears a pork-pie hat telling us \"I was Na'vi before it was cool\"\n\nWhy are new Na'vi so amazed by the ever so slightly larger canine teeth, like every one of them, runs their tongue over them and acts all surprised? Not the insane ponytail that integrates with other life, or the tail, or pointy ears. its canines are at best 2% bigger than human canines which is mindblowing. Ugh.\n\nAvatar makes an accidental but pretty strong case for a Creator, in that Naavi are really basically humans with very small differences (aside from the plug&play ponytails), they ride creatures that are almost identical to horses, and Pterodactyls are their means of flying we meet species very close to whales and dolphins. The trees are pretty much trees. However, it's also clear that the Na'vi are not native to Pandora, they're invaders as much as the Humans. They have two eyes and four limbs, no other creature follows this biological structure where six limbs and four eyes are common. The singular Na'vi integration braid is perhaps an indication they're native, but then the Na'vi can also breed with the demi-human Na'vi meat suits so perhaps that's a survival mechanism of their invasive species, or something brought about by the over-mind that controls all life on Pandora.\n\nThey also skip the fact humans have essentially created immortality with entirely perfect cloning tech (let's not get into the arguments of continuation of consciousness in clones) and instead just use that to make the good guys blue too. (I think we're supposed to be in favour of the Naavi, but it's hard to sympathise with the racist and insular misogynists chock to the brim with \"you're the older brother you look after your younger brother\" machismo.\n\nThey want to 'pacify' the locals, they have a total understanding of the genome as they can create clone bodies that can reproduce. It's inexplicable why they decide to use grunts to do this via ineffective raids rather than the (admittedly horrifying) choice to just use a bioweapon to wipe out the problem. Given the need to resettle Pandora, they're going to need to terraform it anyway to change the atmosphere so everything living there is going to die. Why wait? It also shifts the moral balance as the Human mission is pitched as \"the earth is dying, humanity with it unless we can settle Pandora\" at which point it becomes us/them survival question rather than the invaders/locals in the first film set up.\n\nThe story made more sense (kinda) when they were after the ridiculously named unobtanium as that didn't require killing all life on the planet. (they sort of address this later when we find out about the magic whale brain juice, but again, they have cloning tech immortality is a) already achieved and b) that level of engineering means they can just produce whale-juice themselves in a factory at scale.\n\n\"We think your Na'vi nature means you won't be spotted as invaders\" - fake Na'vi proceeds to wear full US military combat gear so the stealth lasts about six minutes.\n\nI'm 36 minutes into this three-hour-long film... This review is going to end up longer than the screenplay. (At a guess it will have more thought put into it too...)\n\nI'm going for a walk...\n\nThe whole premise of cloning the marines into Na'vi was they were then as fast and strong as the locals but had better training. Given almost all of them then die in the first encounter it reads as nothing more than a way to bring back Stephen Lang.\n\nThe humans torture a child. Maybe because they'd not really established the humans as the bad guys prior to this so they wanted to really hit it home.\n\nOh, there's a bunch of beach Na'vi. Why would you live in a swamp when you could chill on a white sand beach? Swamp Na'vi really got the raw end of the deal. They're a slightly different colour and have different tails. They look a lot like Atlanteans from Marvel. they have flipper forearms. How different do they have to be to be a different species? Given the flippers, different colours and big tails its weird they're so hung up on the specific differences between the human/Naavi hybrids and the forest Naavi they probably never met before.\n\nThe wife Naavi (she rarely gets named or spoken to in this film) is very huffy and superior about the nice tent with the sea view given they literally live in a dirt hut at home.\n\nLots of long dragging scenes of swimming. I'm sure they'd be lovely in IMAX 3d, but without it is painful.\n\nThe whole sub-plot of the kids disliking each other and fighting is so discordantly CW and pointless. There's a planet-ending threat coming, Humans are going to commit omnicide on this planet and we're watching a couple of teens slap each other around?\n\n1h17m in, I'm not sure what the actual plot is. No one asked about Unobtanium yet, do humans not want it anymore? (No, they don't they have a new magic thing to find now, its on whales rather than trees so what a coincidence that Sullys now hanging out on the ocean rather than in a tree.)\n\nI binged ExtraOrdinary earlier, 4-hour show, Was more engaged after the first two episodes than I am in Avatar. If you have 3h10 minutes spare, watch the first seven episodes of ExtraOrdinary. Its much better written.\n\nWe get a whole mouse and the lion scene. I'm sure in 3D IMAX it wouldn't be a boring waste of our time.\n\nWe're almost halfway through. So far nothings actually happened.\n\nWe get some dangerous nonsense that medical science doesn't work but some chanting and acupuncture work miracles. In a world of ever-increasing hostility towards science, Cameron promoting woo is concerning especially given the guy is a self-proclaimed explorer.\n\nTaking another break to play GTA.\n\nAt least half of this movie should be left on the cutting room floor and we're only halfway done.\n\nThe water Na'vi turn green. It's unclear why. Not enough chlorine in the ocean is my assumption.\n\nThere are whalers in space. It's literally the side plot of a Futurama episode at this point, and not as clever. We get a throwaway line that there's immortality juice in them thaar whales. Again, this is a future where humanity has flawless mastery of genetics. Once they know that they can just manufacture it infinitely and for less cost than an interstellar whaling operation. Christ. Does no one even cast a glance over Cameron's scripts anymore? Is he scribbling this stuff in crayon whilst muttering to himself about how he's a modern-day Alexander Pope.\n\nIt's midnight and I just can't bring myself to watch another hour.... The film continues tomorrow...\n\nAnd it's back.\n\nThe underwater fight scene is kinda cool, but with the bad Na'vi guy flying perfectly on a pterodactyl and the blue Na'vi already masters of the ocean, you have to wonder how hard it is to learn these skills the natives are so proud of. It's a bit HFY. Natives spend their lives mastering it, but Humans can rock up and be better at it in 20 minutes.\n\nWhy can the net they are using specifically to capture the Na;vi be cut by primitive tools, why not use woven steel netting?\n\nThe Na'vi have one gun and a bunch of spears. Humans have machine gun emplacements. So get an actual free-willy scene (from the outcast Whale, the one whale in all the world who has broken his species' pacifist oaths (yes, this was a thing, yes its stupid, but I have to choose which stupid things to complain about or this review would never end.)) which serves as a needed distraction for the doomed Na'vi to charge the base. They're fortunate absolutely none of the professional soldiers maintained the position they were given or heard the war cries. Once the element of surprise is gone the outgunned Na'vi start to lose badly, only helped by the people with guns who can't shoot straight from a stable gunnery platform, but the people with spears can be thrown with pinpoint accuracy from a leaping fish.\n\nWe've not really had anything about the world/spirit particularly other than the kid's epilepsy moment earlier that lead to the woo, but given it already tamed the Na'vi and brought them into the planetary 'balance', you have to wonder if the upcoming films will be Humanity against the group-mind trying to subsume their individuality. Terraforming against a group mindset on enslaving and converting humanity to be a piece of the ecosystem's balance would be interesting. We know from Avatar 1 after all the world spirit can and will take over life and direct it to its death if it's for the greater good. The Na'vi frame it as spiritual, but it's hard to not see it as anything other than terrifying enslavement to an indifferent god.\n\nSpider knocks a soldier unconscious and then removes the soldier's mask. Given it's a battle, he's just killed this guy for his own amusement. It's never mentioned again.\n\nSpider's clone father suddenly cares about him. Despite this never once being shown. Spider also saves his fake father. This is the same kid to ten minutes ago murdered a defenceless soldier for fun. Seems unlikely.\n\nWhat's the point of a final showdown between Sully and Lang, given they've shown no reason they can't churn out dozens or hundreds of copies of Lang? How useful is killing him in an honourable dual actually? They're both blue, but Lang fights with a human knife. Sully with a Na'vi knife. Such insightful and deep symbolism. It's literal pottery. Oh no, they're going to drown. Despite the fact, the entire film is about the fact Na'vi can hold their breath for hours. Na'vi a heavier than water. Who knew? Seems super unlikely given the planet must have lower gravity than earth due to Na'vi being tall and slender. (though as an invasive species, I guess that doesn't necessarily track).\n\nThe Definitely Not Jesus Na'vi sends glowing fish to find her family whilst wearing glowing wings. It's not quite as heavy-handed as Snyder's Jesus symbolism, but it's not great.\n\nThey then give the body of the dead child to the monstrous over-mind to eat or protect, or consume or something. The glowing lights make it look nicer than decomposition I guess. The more I think about it, the more terrifying this overmind becomes. How much agency does Sully actually have since connecting to the Tree in the first film?\n\nSully then narrates how he shouldn't run away and needs to fight. So we've spent three hours getting back to where we were at the end of Avatar 1.\n\nVerdict: C+ it's pretty and I'm sure in IMAX 3D it would be spectacular and the dragging scenes wouldn't drag so badly as the scene would be immersive, but the story is weaker than the first film which is an achievement, but not a good one. Cut an hour off the run time by ditching some of the teenaged angst plots and perpetual cycle of captured children, rescued children and it would be a stronger film.\n\nI read a review which called \"Avatar\" Cameron's \"Magnum Opus\" That comment is more offensive than anything I've written above. The man gave us Terminator, Terminator 2, Aliens, True Lies and Titanic, every one of them better than Avatar which, in turn, is better than Avatar 2.",

        content: "The mother is portrayed as an intolerable shrew and the father as a bumbling incompetent, making them reminiscent of every sitcom couple from the 90s. I must admit, from our limited time meeting them, it seems like the girl may be better off without them. We later find out that the mother is homeschooling her child, which is not surprising.\n\nThen we meet the aunt, who seems to have stepped out of a lifetime Christmas movie. \"I don't need a family or husband; I have my fancy career in the big city building sex robots. I mean fully articulated childlike androids.\" They know that parents are not the audience that will be buying these dolls, right? It's 100% going to be perverts. The venn diagram between owners of these dolls and people on the sex offenders registry is a perfect circle.\n\nSomehow, the key takeaway we get from the therapist is that she's patronizing, which is kind of a bad primary skill for a child therapist specializing in bereavement. She's very judgmental of the aunt, who has vintage toys and has not immediately given them to the poor child.\n\nAlso, why is the owner letting the lead scientist work with no supervision? Adding spyware to the toys without approval? And why is the innovation scientist also in charge of scaling mass production to manage price? Wouldn't that be procurement?\n\nSay what you will about Chucky. It's the same film, but instead of dubious business info, they use the tried and true \"it's Magic. I ain't got to explain shit.\" We are 20 minutes in, and the aunt has ditched the kid to work because she had 'an entire week off' for her sister dying in a weird snow-explosion. Truly, American Capitalism is the monster here.\n\nThe kid pretty quickly gets over her parents dying and basically manipulates the aunt into giving her M3gan so the aunt can go back to ignoring the kid. It's presented as wholesome, but it really isn't.\n\nA few hours of work, and M3gan has gone from an actual dumpster fire of non-functional software and hardware to something that would easily pass the Turing test. Again, they're saying 'child's toy' for this technical marvel. That couldn't possibly cost less than a billion dollars to make.\n\nM3gan can diagnose learning difficulties. They drop that in as an aside. But let that sink in: a bonus feature that made psychologists redundant.\n\nThe lead scientist also writes the commercials for some reason. Maybe if she didn't do all these random duties of other people, she'd have had time to read a book or two about the dangers of rogue AI... and maybe program in a failsafe or two... Ah well.\n\n\"Hey, maybe we shouldn't use this recently bereaved and very ill child to demo M3gan to the board....\" is a thought none of them had. Even though using the lead designer's niece is bad experimentation practice.\n\nM3gan has a weirdly terrible microphone and lots of static and grain in the replays. I assume the engineer is a fan of vinyl and is going for the retro vibe.\n\nAlso, M3gan breaks into Disney-style songs. It's utterly cringe.\n\nWhy does Kurt have access to the engineering files? He's a Gopher. A gopher who's been watching porn at work and been caught at it. In a toy company. It's not going to take them long to figure out who the leaker was.\n\nWhy does the therapist have access to M3gan? What NDAs did she sign? She is the only person actually asking valid questions. Conveniently, the kids all brought gigantic toys to the outdoor school thing, so M3gan looks slightly less obviously out of place, but still, in a pile of bears and rabbits, a human-looking Lolita doll stands out. Still, why did our engineer decide to bring M3gan out in public, despite being told priority 1 was no leaks, then leave this billion-dollar bit of kit unattended to make small talk and jam sandwiches?\n\nNaturally, there's a violent bully. M3gan kills him after a bit of light torture. But he was kind of a dick, so I guess we're supposed to be happy about it?\n\nWe get a few bars of Titanium. Becca and Chloe did it better.\n\nThere's a slight touch of GladOS to M3gan's voice, which is nice.\n\nIt's unclear why M3gan is a sociopath killer who tortures her victims. Her primary program is clear, and it is to protect the kid, so swift would be the natural response to that and, as far as possible, untraceable.\n\nM3gan is supposed to record everything but has sufficient control over its own OS to stop that.\n\n\"We've taken every precaution to stop her from hurting anyone\" - we have seen zero evidence they did this. In fact, about 10 minutes later, the scientist explicitly says \"I didn't give you any of the proper protocols\" - let that rest a moment. She knew she hadn't done the most basic safety policies but was cool with mass-producing M3gans and sending them out into the world, with no safety but super strength and speed. And why? What's the driving rush? Is it to save lives? Nope, it's just because a businessman set an arbitrary deadline, and the team needs to hit it. This is why Waterfall delivery is bad, children. It leads to killer robots.\n\nInexplicably, they decided to keep the killer doll in earshot of the unbalanced kid who was screaming. Despite M3gan's primary program, this goes nowhere. Something narratively clumsy can be excused for a setup, but when it's pointless and clumsy, it should be on the cutting room floor.\n\nM3gan costs $10,000, which is nothing. They've literally created a super-soldier, psychiatrist, teacher, manual laborer, serial killer (oops).\n\nOh, M3gan has gone full super-computer. She can take over cell phones and computers of all sorts.\n\nThey gave M3gan super speed and super strength. Because if there is one thing toy manufacturers are known for, it is ensuring kids' toys are very durable.\n\nM3gan decides to spend some time sitting in the dark playing piano creepily.\n\nThe fight between M3gan and her creator is fun, and the 'palliative care' line is cheerfully creepy.\n\nThe Bruce reveal is so stupid, and I hate that I loved it.\n\nM3gan can survive being torn in half. Why precisely did they do that? Seriously, this toy is so insanely over-engineered.\n\nAnd of course, M3gan got into the 'Alexa' despite that being nonsense.\n\nIt's a bad film told badly, with characters making bad decisions for bad reasons.",

And while it is full of clichés and is more than a bit incoherent, it still manages to be enjoyable.\n\nThe movie also pays (accidental) homage to some popular video games and comics. For instance, the dragon and realm of the gods are straight out of Skyrim, which will delight fans of the game that there is yet another medium Todd had us pay for Skyrim in. Additionally, we get a version of the mirror realm from Dr Strange. However, the WW scene feels tacked on and doesn't add much to the plot, it likely wouldn't have happened if the DCEU was continuing.\n\nDespite its flaws, the character of Freddie steals the show with his humour and unlikably likeable personality. Although the Anne subplot is a bit tired and predictable, it doesn't detract much from the overall enjoyment of the movie.\n\nOverall, Shazam! is a movie that is better than it has any right to be, and it's a refreshing change from the darker and more needlessly grim DC movies that we've seen in recent years.",

        tagline: "It's entertaining, but not nearly the sensation the first one was.",
        content: "I'm going to start with how hilarious it is that Shuri spent half the movie in a lab trying to synthesize a herb with magical healing properties, given that the actress is an anti-vaxxer. It's still odd for Wakanda to be a fight-club-based monarchy, particularly as they're no longer ruled by a superhuman. The Queen's decisions around Okoye reinforce the problems of unfettered power.\n\nThe green screening when they are in Wakanda isn't great; the light in the foreground and background just don't match.\n\nNamor is a travesty of his character. He would never yield, no matter the impact; he's too proud by far. The fact that he can't even pronounce his own name is a little embarrassing... It's SO strange that they've changed everything about this character but kept his silly ankle wings. The one thing you know wouldn't work in live action is what they kept. But it's nice to start seeing mutants in the MCU. I just can't see his and Sue's relationship working as it should. But his hatred of scientists and progress bodes well for the conflict with Mr Fantastic. The Atlanteans being racist, murdery assholes is about right though. The statement of 'breathe the air our ancestors breathed' is a weird way to describe your mum, Namor, given that you literally just finished saying she took a herb and transformed into a water breather.\n\nHaving just got back from visiting Mayan ruins, it is cool seeing some of them in BP2, and seeing the underwater Pok Ta' Pok being played. With a sub-aquatic Mayan culture, we now have two ultra-powered nations who just watched colonisation when they could have stopped it and chose not to. Maybe this should be called \"Black Panther 2: Killmonger's Still Right.\"\n\nM'Baku is great. Both his plans and his pointed mockery of the Council. Wakanda would probably have been better off just putting him in charge rather than T'Challa back in Movie 1.\n\nShuri wandering around in a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air style tracksuit is hilarious. Okoye just threw a jacket over her uniform and called it a day. I'm glad someone did something about Ross's ongoing treason. Kinda annoying he got broken out, as normally countries just abandon their spies if they get caught.\n\nRiri's intro is better than it has any right to be given the mediocre source material. The suit's not as good as the comics, but Ironheart's suit is a bit too much like Ironman's in the comics, so it's better it's more different. But it drags like nobody's business between her intro and her getting to do anything at all.\n\nIt's difficult to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus as anything other than VEEP when she's in this film, so it's hard to see her as capable.\n\nThere must be a very rich builder in Wakanda, given how often people ram their spearpoints into the floors.\n\nMichaela Coel was criminally underused, but still awesome to see her. Between Chewing Gum, Black Earth Rising, I May Destroy You, and now the MCU, she's really showcasing range.\n\nDumbest moment: Shuri and her mother talk about AI, and Shuri disregards the risk of rogue AI, saying, \"it's not like the movies, mother,\" when she lives in a world where a rogue AI literally almost ended the world a couple of years before.\n\nSecond dumbest: a water mask for Atlanteans that inexplicably also works as an oxygen mask for regular people. Why would that be a feature designed in? \"Join me in my war or I will wash you from the face of the earth\" is a really stupid way to try and get a trustworthy ally, especially after murdering the Queen. Like, at this point, assume they are your enemy. (Also, the Queen gets her face on the coffin, but T'Challa just gets the Black Panther mask? Odd choice).\n\nIt's also entirely unclear why Wakanda doesn't bring in allies of their own. Even without national treaties, they're owed some favours from some people who could quite rapidly solve the Namor issue. But that's a critique of every Marvel film that doesn't feature the Avengers. Fun, pretty film, but the plot doesn't really hold up to any thought.\n\nThe bit with the secret kid who will be Black Panther is stupid and borderline misogynistic to Shuri now she's taken the mantel. It's a bit of Marvel saying (again) we don't think our female leads can carry a franchise.",

There's like one moment of him adjusting to the new world (Mirrors are a new thing to him, he has no issue with guns, helicopters, televisions or cars) otherwise he's as modern as anyone else. And the cringe-inducing JSA announcement that 'we're here for Global Stability' is just silly, they may as well be saying 'we're here for the military-industrial complex, keep being subjugated peasants'.\n\nAn hour in and the stakes have never been lower. Literally, there are no stakes at this point in the film other than some obnoxious kid who has a serious deathwish, Adam squishing regular people, (who are members of intergang but have no way to hurt him) more for something to do than any real motivation from the character. The JSA are ineffectively wandering around occasionally fighting him or talking to him but mostly just bantering with each other. Adam also gets into the bantering. This is tonally odd for an ex-slave from 5,000 years ago who became a rage-fueled god. And then 20 seconds later he totally fails to understand humour. It's jarring. You can feel The Rock's manager pushing for \"more quips! Marvel made a movie in a CAVE WITH QUIPS!\" to try and reach their success rather than Snyders's deeply mediocre achievements.\n\nThe government's specialists in dealing with Meta Humans, Task Force X, just leave supervillains lying around the loading bay available for anyone to wander over to and has no training or weaponry to defeat a regular person let alone a supervillain.\n\nUgh and \"this villain died clutching a mystical artifact specifically related to Death.\" \"ok, cool, let's shove him in a bodybag and ignore him and leave it with him.\" Bringing back Adam once he's contained because 'he's the only one who can defeat the bad guy' when Superman exists and is explicitly referenced and shows up later as a favor to Waller is insanely daft and poorly scripted.\n\nShazam is the better Shazam movie and it's not even close.",

Also, Snyder is a hack and should never be allowed to direct a superhero film. (I know he didn't direct this one, but it bears repeating because he's so very incompetent.)\n\nPattinson's voice is terrible; it's uncertain and hesitant rather than driven and lacks any sense of authority. Ironically, Gordon's (Bernard) natural-speaking voice would have been an outstanding Batman.\n\nThe junior joker gang at the start is nice, very Beyond or Dark Knight Rises. I was hoping for a 'Shway' to be thrown in. It's not a good sign that our first real encounter is slapstick with a car accident (and we'll keep getting poorly placed slapstick throughout), and then we get Darth Vader-style entrance music, which is a little too on the nose. The VO doing lines like \"I am the shadows\" is way too 2009 Tumblr 3edgy5me, and the sadboi soundtrack is grating. Is he vengeance or is he a sad emo boy? Pick a tone. This is an ongoing problem. It's super dark (no, really, the cinematographer apparently graded the film using black paint), but with slapstick. He's got hyper-tech, but writes in a journal and chalk. He's a billionaire, but his suit doesn't fit (it's like he's wearing the clothes of a much larger man). He does a cool escape, then messes up, and we get a jackass-style result.\n\nThe aesthetics of the Batcave are great. The Batsuit looks great. The eye makeup is surprisingly fun as a reveal, though cowl off it does push Bruce more to emo again. Love the silly bat contacts, and we're at least getting some consistent Detective, which is, ya know, Batman's whole thing and the main reason I'm not a fan of Nolan's work is that you could do a find/replace on Batman with Ninja in Dark Knight, and it would be a stronger film.\n\nThe casting for the 'riddler' is just hot garbage and would have worked better as Professor Pyg as that's kinda what they're doing. Riddler's almost as bad as Leto's Joker (and worse than Ledger or Phoenix who wasn't exactly good). When you watch it and unironically think 'I miss Jim Carrey,' you know you dun goofed. Penguin's solid, though he's more Falcone than Cobblepot, but given we've had DeVito & Robin Taylor's Penguin, I can see why a director who knows he's fucked up casting so badly with Riddler would play it safe.\n\nYes to gliding with his cape! No to doing it as a wingsuit so he looks like a flying squirrel... It's a bit off-brand for Batman to sit around shirtless; part of his whole psychosis is seeing himself as Batman, and Bruce is a mask. He's always in the suit, maybe without the cowl, when he's working in the cave. But show me a superhero film that doesn't lean into a bit of beefcake, and this is less gratuitous than Batflek's Crossfit session or half of Marvel's moments.\n\nIt's madness to me that there's another 1h20m still to go at the 1h30 mark.\n\nBut so far, no pearls falling to the ground. This is a massive step up from seeing it three times when Snyder drew his Justice League screenplay in crayons.\n\nThe neck collar on a prisoner is so huge it would just fit back over his head.\n\nRandom dog being all IDGAF swimming about is top tier. (Note, The Batman would be improved by the addition of Dog-Welder as a sidekick instead of the bland Catwoman.) Oh yeah, Catwoman is in this. I'm struggling to think of any examples of agency she shows at any point that isn't reacting to Batman.\n\nToo many 'end of Fight Club' shots in this film.\n\nCurious to know who the mayoral candidate will turn out to be. No way she's good. She's alive and in Gotham politics.\n\nThere is an EW review that I read that described Justice League as \"Everything takes forever to go nowhere,\" and that is true here as well. It is an ongoing problem in DC's films, with rare exceptions (WW, Shazam, Aquaman). They are so desperate to seem deep, dark, edgy, and 'real' that they spend hours dragging you through stories that just do not matter.",

        content: "Known as the nicest man in Hollywood (a bar that has lowered dramatically in the past decade), Tom Hanks decides he needs to build a robot to look after his dog and ignore all the suffering humans in this broken world (I can empathize, Goodyear's a cutie). Big sandstorms seem to be the main issue the world faces, so it's safe to assume Africa is totally fine given that it's currently a regular occurrence downwind of the Sahara.\n\nAt first glance, the apocalypse can only have happened a week or two before given the delicate wind farms still working despite the mentioned massive sandstorms (it was apparently 10 years ago though). In his private bunker, which he decides to leave due to a convenient storm that hasn't happened in the past ten years, Hanks has a robot destroying books to scan them, which is a super weird choice given that it has already happened pre-collapse and access to them disappeared due to, you know, the collapse. So maybe he should be preserving books as analogue information rather than reducing humanity's already dwindling information for his own personal server? We're 13 minutes in, and I'm already of the opinion that Hanks is doing more harm than good for the world.\n\nHe then makes some really terrifying decisions in the fourth directive he's created. Legit terrible ideas that will lead to a second apocalypse. But this isn't a film that explores interesting ideas. It's a family buddy movie that leans heavily on the fact Hanks is a lovely man playing a lonely one, a dog who is adorable, and a robot that is kinda fun even if it flails about like Lee Evans being tasered.\n\nA better script and a better director would have made this a much better film. Give it Fallout's tone of apocalyptic horror, humor, and desperation. Follow Hanks as he accidentally releases a paperclip optimizer AI on the world. Instead, we have Hanks just being weirdly short-tempered with his groundbreaking leap forward in artificial consciousness because it isn't understanding idioms on its first day of consciousness.\n\nReturning to Hank's terrible planning. Sandstorms are a big thing for some reason, to the point cities are a few feet deep in sand. But despite having full robot building facilities, he's not bothered weather-sealing his robot creations.\n\nThis film is slow, but not 'slow because it's doing a lot of world-building to a crescendo'. It is slow because it has nothing interesting to say.\n\nAlso, Hanks decides near the end to dress up like one of those ultra-racist southern 'gentlemen,' which is a weird choice. But maybe his character was a racist. Who knows, everyone is dead, so he didn't get to show us if he is or not.\n\nBut American Pie's a banger.",

Reed is written perfectly—brilliant, insufferable, and just creepy enough to remind us why body-horror stretching should be part of the package—though his actual powers are undercooked. Sue finally gets her due, from ultrasound scans to smart stealth tactics, even if the \"mama bear\" boost is cliché. Johnny's downgrade to \"ugly but smart\" is a head-scratcher, but his fire looks great and his Surfer crush tracks. Surfer herself (yes, herself) is well-done if not quite reflective enough to sell the cosmic mirror concept. The clip-show intro is genius, the FTL ship is stunning, and the satirical nods to humanity's selective skepticism hit harder than some of the punches. Galactus looks right but comes off a bit small—and yeah, the nose is distracting. Still, this is sharp, stylish, and finally makes Marvel's First Family feel like the legends they are.",

        content: "Herbie is great, lets start with that. The clip show talkshow intro is really smart and works really well both tonally and in a storytelling context. Giving us Moleman and Red Ghost as clips introducig them on stage is great worldbuilding. The 60s retro futurism is amazing, really impressivly done, the mix of styling and constraints is impecable. such as printing physical records for the audio transmissions, because they're still analoge evenw ith FTL. I want a darkwashed version of the asthetic for a live action BTAS immediatly.\n\nThe interesting thing of an empty seat for latvera in the FF/UN meeting is facinating given the stinger, it means Sue know's who's in the green cloak.\n\nWe get the best looking Thing by miles. Not even close. The actor and the CGI really conveys Ben's good heart and deep depression. I enjoy his beard, but they could have had fun with him using a chisel like a straight razor. I'm not sure why we get Natasha Lyonne as \"Rachel Rozman\" for a love interest when she looks just like Alicia Masters and we get a namecheck on Puppet Master. I can only assume its so we can get the synagogue scene, though they shy away from giving Ben an explicit need for his Rabbis spiritual guidence. WHich is deeply odd given he's perhaps the most famous Jewish superhero in comic media. (And no, before the casuals come in claiming Spider-Man is jewish, he is not. Peter B. Parker in Spiderverse is implied to at least be a convert with the wedding flashback, but 616 is cannonically an agnostic who was raised protestant by his irish-american family).\n\nJohnny plays a more crucial role than normal, which is great, but it's odd that they've gone down the ugly but smart Johnny route. Given his whole thing is being the handsome, charming playboy. His fire powers are great though, particularly when he's just a bit on fire. His statement as to why he likes the Silver Surfer is because \"I could see my face in her face\" is quite comics' Johnny though. His insistence on working through the translations and setting up the whole audio presentation is great.\n\nThey establish a really good balance between Reed and Sue. His constant prioritisation of science over social expectations and him struggling to see why it matters \"Anyone can build a crib, only I can build this\" and no understanding why she's upset he chose the machine over the crib even as she knew he would and accepts it. Reed's overreacting and trying to solve all crime in NY is great very Reed and the line he walks between hero and Maker. His powers are probably the weaknesst in terms of what we see. We see the genius, but not the body horror that is Reed at his best. He moves his kids to his face to sniff him, rather than moving his nose to the kid like Reed should. He barely stretches even with Galactus pulling him. He's disappointing for that. Especially as that's why Ms Marvel didn't have stretching powers on her show, because Reed was coming and they wanted to reduce confusion. (leading to her comic character getting new mutant powers to synergise, which is so bonkers it could be a comic plot.) Reed's attitude though, this is the reed who would or will labotomize his son to save planets. He'd do it knowing Sue won't forgive him, but he'll do it.\n\nThe invisible woman's use of her power as an ultrasound is *chefs kiss*. Her hiding the ship as they explore is great too. The films rarely make the most of her invisibility, too much of the force fields. I really enjoy her balance of frustration and acceptance of Reed. She knows who he is, but sometimes, you can see from her face she wishes he wasn't quite so Reed all the time. The 'Mama Bear' powerboost is predictable and always a bit trite. I also like her pushing Galactus back, but its clear she can do it because of leverage and weights. She's not stronger than him, she's stronger than Galactus like some incels shrieked, she's stronger than the tarmac.\n\nSurfer is good, though Norin Rads baldness translates better on screen to Shalla-Bal's hair. The mostionlessness of it makes it more like a helmet. I wish the Surfer was a bit more reflective, I think that would look amazing in space, to be reflecting the stars and nebula around her. Surfer surfing lava is a great visual. Dumb, but great.\n\nThe FTL ship. I love it. It is beautiful. The mix of retro and future! The weightlessness! Ben's space suit not actually covering all of him because he doesn't need it to is a great touch.\n\nFF: \"we are going to teleport the world to a new solar system billions of miles away\"\nHumanity: \"Sounds good. No concerns, we'll do everything we can!\"\n\nReal life: \"We need you to wear a mask due to the overwhelming data it saves lives\"\nHumanity: \"We don't believe you!! I'm going to cough in the face of the elderly to prove you are wrong\"\n\nPlease note: There was no teleportation bridge on the moon, so the teleport would have ruined the eartha ecosystem regardless.\n\nGalactus is very accurate but maybe a bit small (he's inconsistent in the comics tbf) And he has a weird nose (sorry if that is just the actors nose)\n\nNot using the person who's power is invisibility to hide the baby during the swap is a choice...\n\nAnd in the end Galactus was defeated with help from Silver Surfer which is very accurate.\n\nGalactus has now met Franklin so when Franklin makes galactus his herald he at least knows who he is.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: Based on the review, I would assign this movie a score of around 65. While it is described as a decent film with strong characterisation for the main character, it suffers from Marvel's lack of faith in the character and questionable casting choices. The misrepresentation of Taskmaster is also a downside. Overall, it seems like a watchable movie, but not necessarily one that will leave a lasting impression.",

        content: "Mostly suffers from Marvel not believing in the character enough to make the film when it was actually relevant, it's actually a pretty decent film overall.\n\nTaskmaster is not Taskmaster at all, which is a shame and the stunt double is so obvious when used that it's almost two different characters in a similar uniform. Would have been better to set it earlier in the timeline and use Winter Soldier, which would be a lot more impactful as a reveal.\n\nSome strong characterisation for Widow, but it's unfortunately too late to care. Location choices are on point though and I now really want to see David Harbour in The Boys as Vlad, but we never will because the TV version isn't fun it's 'realistic'.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: If you've got a spare eon and enjoy seeing superheroes in a midlife crisis, this film's for you. 'Justice League: Snyder Cut' redefines 'epic' in length, if not in substance. A cinematic equivalent of a marathon with scenic detours – plenty of them. Snyder stitches together a patchwork quilt of origin stories, slow-mo shots, and brooding heroes with enough firepower to start a small war. The plot? As focused as a cat in a laser pointer factory. Flash stumbles around like he's learning to walk, Batman's your gun-toting uncle at a BBQ, and Superman's as cheerful as a Monday morning. Darkseid saunters in, giving a masterclass in 'how to be a cosmic killjoy'. And if you're into watching superheroes take mud baths, this film's got you covered. Just don't expect coherence or brevity - it's Snyder, after all.",

We've had maybe 15m of plot progression and a lot of self-indulgent explanatory scenes... Tonally more consistent though, the cinematography is nice, and the score is good…\n\nWhy do we always get the name Barry Allen, but the character of Wally West?\n\n2h in.\n\nWe've seen the origin story of a random waitress, multiple basically identical bars on Nordic Islands (which, speaking from experience, don't exist), a brief glimpse of a way more interesting story with Darkseid's first visit.\n\nIt's weird. DC does massive-scale action way better on film than Marvel. The Darkseid interlude looks significantly better than the Ultron swarm, but the minute the action gets close for some single hero work, it looks cheesier than the CW shows. Flash runs like the actor never actually used their legs before(which given how much time he spent running from the Police is a surprise). Wonder Woman lacks any sense of mass. Batman fights like someone's dad in a Halloween costume... Aquaman's OK.\n\nNote to Hollywood, starting a villain's intro by telling us what a failure he is, and how he is considered a complete loser by the people who sent him to be an antagonist, doesn't make him that threatening... Making him grovel and beg in almost his first scene…\n\nSteppenwolf plans what he will write in his diary about today.\n\nIf they'd skipped that grovelling and being told he was a loser and had the league struggle to defeat him, really struggle, even with Superman, then as they are about to win, have Steppenwolf be casually and easily crushed by Darkseid, saying \"You were ever a disappointment Uncle\" and then just turn around, ignore the heroes and walk off (to find a comfy chair. Darkseid loves other people's comfy chairs), it would have made the point more strongly.\n\nWe could probs have skipped the scene with the shovels... But it wouldn't be a Snyder film if it wasn't needlessly grim but with discordant jokes…\n\nWW and Aquaman taking a bath in brown water with Superman's corpse is pretty effing weird as a visual…\n\nChrist, there's still 1.5h left of this film…\n\nThat's an entire film left of this film…\n\nAmazon's taking a collective break in the middle of a war of extinction to conduct an elaborate funeral service is so on-brand that I think Snyder may have read some comics to come up with the idea…\n\nGotta suck for Jason, when Henry turns up shirtless. Being the second most ruggedly handsome guy in a film is a new experience for Mamoa.\n\nSuperman's eyes glow.\n\nA deep glow, like fire.\n\nThe glowing eyes are on-point. Very Lex Luthor: Man of Steel.\n\nThe Superman/JL fight is much the same and reinforces DC's problem with the cinematic JL (that they addressed in DEAU by just making Superman job a lot) that Superman outclasses the rest of the league combined. Marvel kinda has that problem with Thor in the early films and Captain Marvel in the later ones, but in both cases, they give in-story reasons why they're not around most of the time.\n\nI've still got 1h20 left... This should have been two 1h40m films and 40 mins on the cutting room floor..\n\nSide note: Marvel/Disney is so confident that Snyder's JL won't make a dent in their bottom line they launched Falcon and Winter Soldier the same week. Give a few years back the two companies played release date chicken, it's a dramatic change…\n\nHmm, weird choice to add a cape to the 80's resurrection suit. Or was Snyder inspired by CW's Crisis and the current Superman....?\n\nWhy is Batman wearing what are clearly Oakley wraparound sunglasses on top of his mask? Is he a BBQing dad from a flyover state?\n\nBatman's still using a lot of guns for a character who (aside from when he was just a Shadow rip-off for a few issues in the 40's) is defined by his refusal to use them.…\n\nSo, at some point, Steppenwolf stopped to do some genealogy research and map out a family tree as there's no other way he'd know Queen Hippolyta was WW's mum…\n\nGood use of multiple Superman powers. Speed, strength, heat-vision in a single sequence. But once again, Snyder makes Superman cruel and brutal in his combat.…\n\nSuperGroundhog\n\nThe strange blending of Justice League and Groundhog Day\n\nThere's still half an hour left. I feel like Bill Murray. (Side note, I could have watched Groundhog Day twice in the film's current running time... )\n\nAh yes, there we go. Not a Snyder film about the paragons of virtue without some casual murder of your enemy.…\n\nYou can't have a 28-minute act and call it an epilogue, Snyder. That's more than 10% of the film. You hack. You absolute hack. Also, 7 acts? 7?!\n\nBruce: \"I'm renovating this mansion and Clark, I bought the bank that owned the debt on your mother's farm. Barry, your innocent dad can rot in jail for all I care. Also, enjoy your job doing scut-work in a crime-lab so you can work long hours to pay for your university course. Now excuse me while I throw razor-sharp batarangs that each cost enough to pay for a month of your tuition at a jaywalker.\"\n\nJesus Kryptonian Christ\n\nWhat Jesus Kryptonian Christ might look like\n\nJesus Kryptonian Christ, the epilogue has an epilogue... like 30% of this film has been origin stories or reveals of other DC stuff…\n\nNice to see post-apocalyptic rules apply. Slade's going all in on maintaining the mohawk.\n\nThe epilogue's epilogue has a fucking epilogue!\n\nOK, it's finally over.\n\nThe Good:\nThe film is consistent in its storytelling, not the Frankenstein's monster that was Whedon's patch job on the base footage. Tonally consistent rather than swinging wildly between Whedon's quips and Snyder's 2edgy4me 14-year-old style.\n\nIt is not as bad a character assassination as Man of Steel or BvS.\n\nThe piano version of Hallelujah (his late daughter's favourite song) runs over the credits and is better than it has any right to be given how overused it is now. Generally, the score is really good, less cheesy than Elfman's work on the original.\n\nSome great cinematography, really strong large battle scenes, and Superman's powers are worked together really well. Also, some good specific visuals around his eyes and the way he holds himself in the air (but honestly that's 100% Cavill and his mastery of all things nerdy)\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's still a terrible film. Honestly, it's not a good film.\n\nIt's much. much. much too long. (It's an entire hour longer than Warhol's experimental film Chelsea Girls for Christ's sake.)\n\nIt is the most unfocused, meandering plot I've encountered in a long time.\n\nSnyder once again shows he really dislikes the characters or doesn't understand them. Batman's a gun nut. Flash is an awkward clumsy failure. Superman's not even a character in the film. He's a plot device at best. You could remove him entirely, and it would make almost no difference. (Snyder does make sure to make Superman do some cruelty after he becomes good again because Snyder confuses edgy and gritty with realistic.) There is zero reason for the impersonation MM does. Given the person he impersonates would do exactly that anyway.\n\nWe get way, way, way too many tangential origin stories, intros, side stories, epilogues, winks to the camera... Keep Cyborg's expanded origin as it connects to the motherboxes (and was done much better in the animated film AND in Young Justice) but kill the Flash scenes, he's been on TV for years, and anyone who cares knows his backstory. Kill the extra Aquaman scenes they don't add anything new now that the Aquaman film is already out. Cut the really really long scene with the waitress to like 10 seconds.\n\nKill all the future shit. Show us the hall of justice, not an empty room with people talking about a round table.\n\nIt's SO long.\n\nThe slow lingering shot on the massive suicide prevention poster is a little discordant and maybe not ideally placed just after Flash says something about having no friends, but I can understand Snyder's desire to include it.",

It does have a couple of really clunky edits that will no doubt be smoothed out in a director's cut one day, in particular, there is a jarring cut to WW in the gold armour flying when she got her powers back and discovered she could fly unaided, it was clearly supposed to be later, during the fight with Cheetah that she regains her powers and releases Steve, but they wanted a touching farewell and that doesn't work if he's not here.\n\nCheetah's obsession with Diana before getting powers is played really well.\n\nNot as good as the first WW film, but way better than BvS or Justice League. It also serves as more proof, (if it was needed) the worst thing to happen to DC films was Snyder and his total inability to understand, care about or appreciate the characters.\n\nIt's a different take on the character, but it works well. Especially for the '80s. The Amazonians have definitely gone to the Hogwarts School of Nonsensical Physical Challenges for Special Children though.\n\nI still don't follow when the sudden costume change that happened in Act 3. I even googled to see if i'd missed something. but no, they appear to have cut that explanation. I remember the backstory, but it seemed like it just appeared between one scene and the next... And would have made more sense to change earlier.\n\nThey skip past the fact that WW and Trevor are making the owner of Trevor's body an unwilling participant in their lovemaking. It's particularly bad given whilst we see Trevor, WW sees the stranger, there is not one moment when she is with him she can pretend she doesn't know what she's done to this poor victim.\n\nPascal is, as always superb.",
