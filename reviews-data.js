        aiSummary: "tldr: James Gunn breathes fresh, colourful life into Superman, delivering the hopeful hero Snyder never could, complete with perfectly snarky Lois, a petty genius Lex, and a hilariously awkward accidental allegory on immigration and geopolitical invasions. It's exactly the fun reboot DC desperately needed.",
        tagline: "I'm glad Snyder is still alive to see this film and see how fully, fundamentally and totally he failed as a screenwriter, director, and person.",
        content: "All in all, this was the hopeful superman we all wanted and haven't seen on the big screen in a couple of decades. The colour pallet was cheerful in the right places, and whilst it perhaps lacked some of Snyders visual beauty, it more than overcame that with just getting the tone right.\n\nIt's a very James Gunn film, so there's quips and sillyness, there are minor characters who are very different from their comic counterparts, but unlike Snyder they are still respected. An example is the use of the Engineer as a Lex soldier. This takes away her agency by having him be the mastermind of the nano-machines which is disappointing. In the comics she does this herself and joins the ruthless Authority. (Though the universe merge of the Authority and DC never really made sense to me)\n\nLex was amazing, the pettiness and general insanity are fantastic. His storage unit of people who have slighted him is chef's kiss. It's the first time in a long time we're seeing the Lex who plans and who's power is so great he can stand toe to toe with Superman, shielded by his intelligence and his ruthlessness.\n\nDavid was great as both Clark & Superman and it was brilliant to see a film start mid-universe not with the origin stories.\n\nLois is great and her pinning Clark to the wall over and over again in their interview was hilarious and the reason she is Pulizer winning and he tends to get it for his novels not his journalism.\n\nMr Terrific was great, though the Mobius Chair look is odd. Guy Gardner is top tier.\n\nGary was great. Justice for Gary.\n\nCool to see such a good use of Metamorpho, including his flying head. It's a shame we'll never get to his partner's appearance in Sandman because Gaiman 'allegedly' can't keep it in his pants.\n\nKrypto is a very good boi.\n\nIts weird we got the Boy's ending/twist that we never got in the Boys. Like it was very obvious from the moment we saw Ultraman's outfit what was coming, but it was a weird choice, like Gunn accidentally copied from the wrong material.\n\nThere's also two plot elements that are really blown up by recent events and I'm not sure either could have been planned due to the time it takes to produce a movie.\n\nSuperman gets arrested by ICE for being an immigrant.\n\nJames Gunn having to come out and insist his invasion in the desert of white europeans led by a traitorous warmonger with an eastern European accent against an oppressed brown population in poverty but who are called terrorists so the invaders can steal the land is not about Isreal and Palestine and all the above is just some weird coincidence is.... something.\n\nA promising start to DC's umpteenth reboot.",

        content: "I, like many people, have been holding space for the lyrics of defying gravity and for this review.\n\nElphaba's mother had an affair with the Wizard. I'm not sure if we're supposed to know that at this stage or if he's supposed to be a mysterious stranger, but its very obviously Jeff Goldblum.\n\nThe parents are strangely horrified by Elphaba being born with green skin given they have a wolf for a midwife and a bear for a nurse.\n\n\"It's alright little one, he shouldn't have blamed you\" Child Elphaba is told by a random bear. Even though she did the thing she was blamed for.\n\nGlinda goes full wickerman on a statue of Elphaba as the townspeople cheer and dance.\n\nThe bubble is fantastic, beautifully done, slightly wobbly and when it pops there's a very subtle rainbow in the air. Love it very much.\n\nThe framing of Wicked is a random townsperson asks Glinda if it was true she was Elphaba's friend on her way out of the village and basically Glinda decides to info dump. Good for us, the audience, probably a pretty frustrating afternoon for the townspeople who had other things to do than sit through five hours of the Good Witch waxing lyrical about her school days.\n\nGlinda goes full Plastic with her 'Blick' and \"strangers are just people I've never met\"\n\nThe students at Shiz are also shocked, horrified and pitying of the girl with green skin. They are completely unphased by the two professors who are talking animals.\n\nWe're told by the staff that true magic is increasingly rare. Naturally Elphaba, who's only supposed to be giving Nessarose assistance to her room gets annoyed and does her levitating trick. Madam Morrible claims credit to keep things quiet, fast tracks her into the school, and plans to privately tutor her. Galinda's horrified that she, for once, hasn't got her way.\n\nThe section of the Wizard and I where she sings about 'de-greenify' is beautifully shot with light coming through spinning coloured glass changing her skin tone through a rainbow.\n\nI think we're supposed to think Galinda's being unfair by only giving a little space to Elphaba in her room, but honestly she was railroaded into having a roommate in her room. She's been reasonably decent about the whole thing and Elphaba's got a pretty big chip on her shoulder about the whole thing for someone who wasn't supposed to be at that school twenty minutes ago. One of the challenges is Ariana Grande is such a likeable person, it carries over to Galinda and its hard to separate it.\n\nGalinda ramps up the mean girl nastiness in front of the animal professor of history and also asks some profoundly stupid questions. \"Poppy's are my favourite, they keep me cheerful in these dark times\" is a doubly cutting comment from the depressed Goat given their medicinal use and their symbolism.\n\nElphaba follows Dr Dilamond and listens in to his private conversations with his friends. He's pretty unfazed by her breach of basic decency. Animals are losing the ability to speak. This is a bit of a horrifying thing to have as a B plot.\n\nFirst Elphaba and then Galinda meet the charming rogue of our story, who is unbothered by Galinda's skin colour and leads the students in a big dance number. His name's Fiyero. He's a student at Shiz. Even though Cynthia and Ariana are hardly school age, this guy gives strong \"How do you do fellow kids\" or the elderly Luke Perry in 90210. The actor is closer to forty than thirty, his child would be a more appropriate age to attend Shiz. Perhaps he is a mature student.\n\nThe roommate scene was already very close to the roommates scene in Wednesday. We then get a very very similar dancing movements from Elphaba at the ball. Galinda, feeling like a pretty terrible person for her behaviour (as Elphaba got her into the sorcery program) mimics her weird crazy person dancing. Ariana manages to bring a certain grace to the odd movements, but Elphaba continues looking like a puppet with an ungainly puppeteer.\n\nThe girls share some secrets and Galinda love bombs the hell out of \"Elphie\". Given no one other than a Goat and an elderly student has ever shown Elphaba even the most basic human kindness this is extremely effective. We then get one of the best songs in the show, Popular.\n\nThe animal Professor tells us it's his last day, and that animals will no longer be allowed to teach. Immediately after that he's dragged off campus by the police. Its a bit weird. I'd honestly have cut the bit with him saying they were not able to speak any more.\n\nApparently 'cages' are a new innovation in Oz. (Which must make it very easy to escape from an Oz prison.) It (rightly) pisses off Elphaba so much she uses her magic to put everyone but Fiyero into an opium induced sleep. Fiyero breaks the cub out of the cage without hesitation. His characterisation is basically Charlie \"Wild Card\" Kelly at this point, its deeply inconsistent. Fiyero questions why he was the only one she didn't effect with the spell, I'd just assumed it was because unlike the other students he's developed a tolerance to opioids due to his many, many, decades of life.\n\nElphaba is summoned to the Wizard, and brings Galinda (now Glinda in solidarity of Dr Dilamond). As they explore the city we're treated to Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth on stage vying for attention on stage during a retelling of the Wizards arrival.\n\nWe get the \"I am Oz the great and terrible\" and then Jeff comes out to say hello and do some very terrible up close magic for us. The Wizard does to Glinda what she did to Boq at the start, calling her Balinda. He's basically playing Grandmaster or Zeus from his more recent outings. All Ego driven generosity. He's pretty much Glinda all grown up.\n\nThe Grimmerie is a deeply inconvenient shape for a book. There's a reason we use rectangles. It's a bit 'different just to be different' honestly. But Elphie casts a spell, as the Wizard and Morrible planned, granting wings to their monkey guards. Elphaba figures out the Wizards a fraud and all his magic is fake.\n\nMorrible rallies the flying monkeys to chase Elphaba telling them \"she did this\" maybe its just me, but if someone gave me giant cool wings that let me fly I'd not be angry and chasing them down, I'd be protecting them. Wings would be AMAZING!\n\nGlinda kills a guy. He's grabbed her leg as they try and escape in the Wizards balloon, and she hits him with a sandbag. he then falls maybe 3 stories to land spine first on a wooden floor.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba face off, and then we get Wicked's best song. I hate to say it, but Cynthia's third for me, after seeing Idina on stage in London and (don't judge me!) Kurt & Rachel face off in Glee.\n\nWith hat and cloak from Glinda, Grimmarie from the wizard and broom by her own craft Elphaba defies gravity.\n\nWorth noting the guards are useless. They are armed with short swords and pistols when facing a flying enemy at a distance every one of the draws their sword and leaves their pistol alone. There would be no sequel if even one guard had been trained.\n\nThe film does suffer from being way too long. Its 2h 40 mins and that's only half of the total film. Its been split in two. The first film is already longer than the stage adaption.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: Miyazaki's latest film is a weird rollercoaster of war orphans, family drama, giant birds, and magical nonsense wrapped in Ghibli's trademark charm. The animation is stunning, but starting to feel dated against newer anime powerhouses (Demon Slayer says hi). The story is packed with odd choices, like a morally questionable dad, creepy herons, and some wildly unhinged plot twists that are both hilarious and head-scratching. The English dub flaunts A-list names, but their performances don't hold a candle to seasoned voice actors. It's bizarrely personal and familiar in that classic Miyazaki way, but it lacks the fresh magic of his best work.",
        tagline: "Miyazaki is never bad, but this film reuses too many of his staples to truly be great.",
        content: "Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and naturally produced by Studio Ghibli, this was the film Miyazaki came out of retirement (again) to direct before retiring (again) upon its completion.\n\nIt starts with common Miyazaki themes: a young boy affected by a war, an incomplete family moving out of a city to a new home in the countryside. In this case, it's so his father can hook up with his dead wife's sister. Like much of Miyazaki's work, the father is absent from much of the film. But given that he's apparently a scumbag, that's perhaps for the best.\n\n\"I'm going to be your new mother from now on. Sound good?\" is an unhinged thing to say to your war-orphan nephew. Having him feel the baby move and telling him it's a new sister or brother immediately had me rooting against this woman and the philandering father.\n\nThe artwork is, of course, impeccable, but the approach and style are showing their age compared to newer anime like Demon Slayer.\n\nJust after they arrive at his new home, and his father's new factory is pointed out in the distance, we see the grey heron for the first time. It flies inside the home briefly, and we're told it's unusual. His new home is expansive, richly appointed, and weirdly similar to the house in one season of Tenchi Muyo! He doesn't live in it, though. He stays in a more regular house nearby.\n\nWe're introduced to a gaggle of potato-faced old women who are all about three feet tall. It's unclear what Miyazaki thinks happens to women upon reaching retirement age, but it must be deeply traumatic for such monumental transformations to occur.\n\nThe boy has a horrifying dream of his mother burning alive and ascending...somewhere. He is running through the flames. Later, the heron leads him to a tower, which he's told was built by his grandmother's uncle, who apparently read too many books and lost his mind. Remember, kids, reading is BAD!\n\nHe gets into a fight at school, but apparently deciding it wasn't serious enough, he bashes his own head in with a rock until blood flows freely down his face. It's weird. He does such a severe job of it that a doctor needs to visit and do stitches. It's also weird when his father says he will get vengeance against whichever child did this to his flesh and blood. Luckily, things get more normal when the heron arrives and says the boy's name a few times.\n\nThe boy heads out with a rattan to confront the heron. It snaps the wooden sword easily with its beak full of human teeth and tells him his mother is not dead. Then there's a chorus of fish and frogs swarming over him, saying, \"Join us, join us!\" His mother-aunt shoots an arrow at the heron and drives the creatures away.\n\nAfter some faffing around, a bit of petty larceny, and some time sharpening a knife, he crafts a bow like his aunt's but from bamboo. It's useless because it's bamboo. He's lucky it hasn't snapped already. He fletches the arrow with a heron feather. He also seems to eat a lot of glue in the process, which explains a few things. The heron feather arrow is magically good.\n\nHe stalks through the forest with one of the potato women, who tries to stop him from going into the tower. He is aware the claim that his mother is alive is a lie and admits he's not that bothered about rescuing his aunt. He just needs confirmation on his mother and is willing to risk the trip. It's pretty hilarious how indifferent he is about his aunt.\n\nThere's a creepy man inside the heron. He's much less threatening once his costume is damaged. He does give off pedophile vibes. The boy then sinks through the floor into a new world, where a pirate saves him from a flock of pelicans at the gates of a graveyard.\n\nWe get a moment typical of a Miyazaki film, a gaggle of tiny, cute creatures! These look exactly like the Adipose from Doctor Who.\n\nThe boy is stoic. There's no other word for it. Despite the strangeness and terror he's facing, he stands firm before it, his voice and demeanor never wavering. It's a common trope in anime for young men.\n\nThere is much akin to Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away in his exploration of this new world, but with more outhouses.\n\nWe cut back to the 'real' world, where the boy's father stops his factory workers from continuing to search for his pregnant sister-in-law/wife and his son so they don't fall behind schedule. I'm assuming he knows of a third sister he can hook up with.\n\nHe meets Himi. She's made of fire and says Nasuko is her sister. I'm sure the fire is just a coincidence to how the boy's mum burned alive. She info-drops that the tower can straddle all different kinds of worlds. We move on, no further questions. We can be sure she's a monster because she puts butter in between the bread and jam for him. He opens up to Himi that his mother's dead. She cheerfully says, \"Mine too!\" No further questions are asked there either.\n\n\"Be careful; in here there are limits to what my power can do,\" Himi tells him in the corridor of doors (a very Midkemia Hall of Worlds reference), which is a terrifying thing to say when you pause and think about it, because it implies there are no limits to her power normally.\n\nThey release an army of giant birds into the real world through the door. The father chops at them with a sword, and then they turn into budgies. The father appears to be slowly losing his mind. Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.\n\nHimi waits until he's electrocuted to tell him not to touch the stone. She's a little bit of a bitch, tbh. He finds his aunt, and she tells him to leave and that she hates him.\n\nThe boy meets his great-granduncle, the tower master. His uncle is playing with children's blocks piled up as a tower. By this point, the boy is dressed like John McClane in Die Hard. The uncle, who would have been a 19th-century Japanese architect, is wearing a black robe adorned with a necklace of turquoise gems, hair that would put Einstein to shame, and a mustache greater even than Sam Elliott's. So he either always was an odd fish, or since joining the tower, gave himself a makeover. The uncle puts a heavy burden on the boy and tells him it's his responsibility to choose which block will be used in his toy tower.\n\nThe boy then wakes up chained to a wall in the budgies' kitchen, only to be rescued by the creepy heron-man. They sneak out of the way comically easily.\n\nAfter a deep conversation with his granduncle, he returns to his world, turning down the chance to create a world of his own. After King Birdman destroys the building blocks and the granduncle starts to die, he tells the boy to run. The boy doesn't even hesitate. He grabs Himi and sprints off, leaving his granduncle to his (well-deserved) fate. The tower collapses. Turns out Himi is his mother! (shock!) and she has to go through a different door. The boy's calling his aunt \"mother\" now for some reason. Seems like a bit of a slap in the face to his actual mother, who's standing right next to him.\n\nThe large birds follow them out the door and turn into small budgies as before. They shit all over the aunt, who giggles, saying, \"So cute.\" It's weird. Everyone kind of arrives together, and the film ends.\n\nThe film is strange and odd in that very special Ghibli way. You forgive the peculiarities because they come with such charm. It's not his most groundbreaking work, but somehow, it's one of his most personal, reflecting his own childhood. In feeling, if not in giant birds filled with men. My opinion of it is colored, I think, by my initial impression of the father and aunt hooking up and having a baby together more or less on the bones of the boy's mother. It's hard to root for her being saved.\n\nThe voice actors for the English dub are very high profile: Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Willem Dafoe, Christian Bale. But a continuing trend of hiring famous actors to do voice work rather than professional voice actors shows.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: This movie is a low-budget, high-concept gem where all the action happens in one dude's house. John Oldman casually drops a bombshell to his friends: he's a 14,000-year-old Cro-Magnon who's hung out with history's VIPs, from Buddha to Van Gogh, and—plot twist—claims to have inspired Jesus. The group debates whether he's a fraud or the real deal, but the story stays just convincing enough to mess with your head. No flashy effects here, just one actor absolutely carrying the film. The ending sneaks up on you with an emotional gut-punch that's both abrupt and effective.",
        tagline: "A surprisingly engaging movie with an unusual premise.",
        content: "It was TikTok that introduced me to this movie, its all-knowing algorithm presenting clips it knew I'd enjoy.\n\nThe entire film is staged in a couple of rooms in John Oldman's house and a little outside by his truck. It's a film where almost nothing happens except one struggle over a gun and a medical emergency. Every other moment is John telling his life story—or telling a wild, fantastical tale.\n\nJohn tells his circle of friends he is a Cro-Magnon man, 14,000 years old. Every ten years or so, he moves so no one notices he doesn't age. His friends, colleagues from the university he teaches at, naturally don't believe him at first and challenge him over and over again.\n\nThey, like us, begin to wonder though—the story hangs together, it makes sense, though he has managed to meet a great many of the most famous people in history. He studied with Buddha. He had the chance to sail with Columbus (but was still slightly concerned there was an edge to the world). He has a Van Gogh painting given to him by the artist. Until one asks if he's ever been a religious figure. It takes some pushing, but he admits he was the basis for Jesus. His most religious friend calls it blasphemy. He simply claims he tried passing on some of Buddha's teachings and then a lot of extra things were attributed to him in the texts.\n\nThe movie ends a little abruptly, with him mentioning where he was ten years before and dropping a name—a name that causes one of his friends to suffer a heart attack in sudden and complete certainty that he knew John's previous identity.\n\nThe cinematography is fine; it's a pretty simple setup, ordinarily lit but personal, as suits the premise. The whole film hangs on John's performance, and you're never quite sure if he's a playful liar trying to ease the sting of his sudden departure or a man deciding to be honest for the first time in an eon.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: In a world craving innovation, \"Wonka\" serves up a stale, half-baked confection. Timothée Chalamet, while easy on the eyes, falls short of the enigmatic chocolatier's legacy, delivering more of a petulant child than a master of confectionary wonders. Set against a backdrop that screams a confused homage to every popular franchise of the last two decades, this film meanders through a plot thinner than budget supermarket chocolate. The attempt to blend humour with a dark origin story leaves a taste as unsatisfying as sugar-free gum. It's a cinematic equivalent of finding a raisin in your chocolate bar - utterly disappointing.",
        tagline: "A prequel no one asked for and even fewer will remember.",
        content: "For some reason despite the outstanding 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the solidly mediocre 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory someone somewhere decided it was time for the Willy Wonka origin story no one asked for.\n\nStaring the androgynous, pixie-sized, youthful Timothée Chalamet as the titular Willy is a strange choice. He lacks the chaotic unsettling energy Depp brought to the role, let alone anything close to what Gene Wilder generated on screen.\n\nIn our first introduction to Wonka, he's a frighteningly naive, stupid child who is also generous and well-intentioned. A very different characterisation to other films where he is a near Loki-like character, a tricker with a gleam of malevolence. He won't hurt you, but he'll do a lot of things to tempt you to hurt yourself.\n\nHis ragged outfit which is a little large is very much the Artful Dodger,(even more so when he adopts his sidekick), making him seem very young. We're told Wonka's been on a sea voyage for 7 years. Chalamet's presence and performance make him perhaps 18, so he was a very young sailor. Or he's Chalamet's real age of nearly 30. Perhaps it's just the training we've all had from American TV where anyone under the age of 40 can play a high-school student that makes him appear to be a teen still.\n\nChalamet's American accent seems extremely out of place as a master chocolatier given America's terrible track record when it comes to chocolate. The extravagance of his creations is rather American, but people insist the chocolate also tastes good, so we must assume Wonka, like Chalamet is, at least half, French.\n\nThere's a huge influence from The Greatest Showman in this film's look. As well as Harry Potter. The opening of his store could easily be swapped with the Weasly Twin's store.\n\nChalamet is consistently aiming for Wilder or Depp in his performance but all I can see is Reese from Malcolm in the Middle. His outbursts are not terrifying or insane they are petulant. I think the issue is, without his Factory, without the environment of magic, wonder and danger he has created, everything Wonka says and does in the grimy London that surrounds him comes across as deranged rather than enchanting.\n\nIn a bizarre nod to the Depp film filmed in Munich and using a lot of local extras, the police are dressed in faux-German WW1 outfits rather than the British Bobbies you'd expect and certain names are very Germanic. Quite nicely, the three rival chocolatiers who confront Wonka in his red velvet code are dressed in primary colours, looking from above like they are a Roses Selection.\n\nWonka rescues a young black girl from a life of slavery. It's played for laughs. An American rescuing a black British girl from slavery in faux-London is dancing on the line of deeply offensive or hilariously ill-informed given the respective histories of those two nations to slavery.\n\nNoodle & Wonka sing a silly song whilst milking a Giraffe. Chalamet's voice is a pretty high key, Alto perhaps and Noodle's is higher, which makes the duet a little shrill. The music is lazy. Rather than creating rhymes, they lean heavily on just creating words. Moodle to rhyme with Noodle. This is a pretty consistent problem throughout the movie.\n\nThe wonder and needed nonsense ramps up finally when they decide to break into the cathedral of the chocoholic monks and the corrupt priest, it's just a shame this is right at the end. If I looked as young as Chalamet, I'd not be willing to sneak into a Catholic Church. Rowan Atkinson is, naturally, outstanding as the priest.\n\nThe drug cartel metaphor is both heavy-handed and lacking in execution. Which is an impressive fumble. Keegan-Michael Key does what he can with his growing addiction but it's also played straight for laughs.\n\nThe reveal is trite and predictable. The Death by Chocolate scene lacks impact given the fact Wonka later successfully uses exactly this sort of deranged approach to dealing with people he dislikes.\n\nChalamet attempts a touching rendition of Pure Imagination, but he misses the mark. Take a watch of the better version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVi3-PrQ0pY&ab_channel=beralts\n\nIt's unclear how Charlie later walks by this distant ruined castle on a daily basis.\n\nThe film was mediocre, which given how good many of the cast are is a little unforgivable. My footnote would be that Chalamet wasn't the actor for this role, he's not got the maniacal presence to bring the edge that Wonka needs. A stronger Wonka would have brought something this film desperately needed.",

Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan brings a nerdy enthusiasm that's as refreshing as finding an untouched slice of pizza the morning after a party. Monica's superhero landing needs work, and the Skrull sympathy play feels like trying to hug a cactus. The CGI swings from \"meh\" to \"passable,\" with a side of cat-rescue missions that make you question your life choices. Clocking in at a merciful 1h45m, \"The Marvels\" manages to entertain without needing to pause for a bathroom break, but it's more of a microwave dinner than a feast for the senses.",
        tagline: "Higher. Further. Faster.",
        content: "Iman carries the movie, her sheer enthusiasm shines through every scene. Her near stalker level insanity when talking to Captain Marvel is somehow endearing. \"I'm on a team with Captain Maaaaarveeeeel!!!\" Kamala's mum tells her 'no space adventures!' whilst she herself is in space is ace and very on brand for the character.\n\nIman is just a Ms. Marvel variant from Earth-1218, she's not acting, this is who she is.\n\nLooking at Kamala's face when she utters \"Oh captain, my captain!\" It's likely that Kamala's got some difficult conversations coming with her more conservative family members.\n\nThe absolute chaos of the first fight is fantastic.\n\nMonica being kinda useless in an emergency, or in space, or on an alien world; whether that's saving Kamala from falling to her death, noticing when Kamala wandered off to be heroic or ignoring Carol when she says not to do anything on the musical world (Side note, Kamala just vibing along in the background is awesome) is great as she's a scientist, not a soldier or a superhero. Normally we get a near-instant transition from people getting powers to them being incredible superheroes.\n\nIt remains hard to side with the Skrulls. I've got too much 616 bias to them. Bring in Reed and let them turn them into cows. This batch are incredibly whiney and self-righteous. Luckily we have very little exposure to them.\n\nKing Valkryie is great, but it really highlights how few good female characters Marvel actually put out that a bit-part character from a Thor film has become one of the bigger names. Don't get me wrong, Tessa Thompson is fantastic each time she's on screen, but the character's not a major player in the mainline Avengers or Thor canon. It's also a bit of a slap in the face how quickly they solve the Skrull housing issue given in Secret Invasion they spent years trying and failing for some reason.\n\nMonica is at least a black woman and Kamala is asian, entirely the wrong ethnicisty, but the continent is right I guess.\n\nI love that it's a Quantum Band, tying the Marvels back to Mah-Vel and Rick Jones. (Kamala insisting on calling it a bangle is funny as it really undercuts the seriousness when they demand it.) They spend a bit too much time talking about the science of this. And deciding that an inhabited planet is the best place for water when comets exist is a little daft. Or you know they have FTL, they've probably figured out how to combine a little hydrogen and oxygen. I know there's a reason, but it's a bad reason. They should separate revenge from survival and pursue them separately.\n\nThe 'training' montage to Intergalactic is great and it's nice seeing Kamala's enthusiasm infecting two typically stoic and dour characters. It also entertainingly shows Carol's agism, in that she chooses the adult with no experience and who's an amateur with their powers to prioritise on mission instead of the youth who's been a hero professionally and knows what to do.\n\nWhat's with hyper-advanced cultures using primitive weapons with a bit of added energy? The Wakandans do it, the singing people do it, the Kree do it...\n\nCarol's absolute lack of anything resembling subtlety in a fight is good, she's typically massively more powerful than anything around her, so a smash and bash is a rational approach, she's never had to learn more.\n\nThe cat-based rescue is stupid. The only saving grace is Kamala being made to do the collecting and being basically in tears about it. We never get an explanation as to why the scientists in Fury's space station are wearing Future Foundation jumpsuits.\n\nThe film is a fairly tight 1h45 minutes, which is great, we've been dealing with epic-length films for so long it's nice to find one that's keeping a good pace. The CGI isn't anything to write home about, but it's not as bad as some Marvel properties have been lately. They've also given Carol a bit more of an aligned look to the other two's powers and toned down the Dragonball Z from her first appearance.\n\nKamala recruiting Kate is great, we knew the Young Avengers was coming, but the fact she uses Fury's lines almost exactly means at some point Tony leaked the entire conversation publically, as no one else was there to hear it.\n\nThe Binary and Beast stinger is good for what it represents, but Beast's CGI is really bad and its not ideal this is the third variant we've seen of Monica's mother, it's a shame she was used in Doctor Strange as it would make the reveal hit harder if she wasnt.",

        content: "I'm going in with the lowest of expectations, but the appearance of a Minion was somehow even worse than I imagined. But the 16-bit Nintendo opening was super cute. Already I suspect there is tension between the fantastic character-loving Nintendo and the entirely soulless Disney machine.\n\nThe animation is not great. It's not awful, but I've played video games with better renders. They have a general softness to them that is reminiscent of Muppets and that makes me sad because the Muppets doing Super Mario Bros would be a far far better film.\n\nThe cast is almost entirely pudgy white men with scraggly beards known for being wacky. We have Jack Black, Chris Pratt, Charlie Day and Seth Rogan, as well as Keegan-Michael Key and Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach. Despite all these people being talented actors (to varying degrees) none of them are voice actors. It's particularly obvious with Day (Luigi) & Pratt (Mario) who do the Italian accents the plumbers are known for a grand total of 20 seconds for a deliberately cringe-inducing TV advert for their plumbing business. Given how many Americans there are who've never been to Italy, have no immediate family from Italy but do proudly claim to be Italian, you'd think they'd find one or two who could manage a credible accent. Particularly as we get a brief meal with their family who are straight out of the Sopranos, so we wonder how they lost their accents, but also developed two different accents despite spending all their time together.\n\nThe big reveal of the Mushroom Kingdom isn't dramatic enough, the colours and vibe of New York were still cartoony and bright. Dry Bones is pretty good though, and the scene of them chasing Luigi has some tension.\n\nThe antique store with the sign written with visible pixels is fab.\n\nPeach's raised thrown under a massive stained glass picture of herself is fantastic and so entirely on brand for her narcissism. She's also a master of unarmed combat and parkour. The scene where she does the training run is basically identical but worse than when we met Princess Fiona. We also get 'holding out for a hero' used less well than Shrek did. We get a scene reminiscent of the Muffin Man torture. Basically what I'm saying is, if you have the option, go watch Shrek again.\n\nBowser sits closer to his subject, throws heavy rock concerts for them, and talks to them directly. He appears to be a better ruler than Peach. He does kill one for questioning him, but as he's immediately Undead, it's fine I guess? His creepy obsession with marrying Peach is horrifying as we are very aware of what 'marry' means in this context, but it's played for laughs.\n\nMario gets really good at everything really fast. But really, he learns the power of friendship. But also relying on himself. And Naruto running. That's important too.\n\nMario gets picked on and degraded by his father at the start of the film, and Luigi is ignored. In the end, his father says \"You were amazing Mario\" and continues to ignore Luigi who was just as incredible. Mario may get closure, but Luigi remains Player 2.\n\nGiven the soundtrack of 80's hits, I wonder if Chris Pratt insisted given on how well it went for his breakout film.\n\nThe best character by far is the cheery, insane, blue flame, captured in a cage. 'There's no sunshine, only Darkness!'\n\nKids will enjoy it, it's loud and colourful and recognisable. It will no doubt sell the various spin-off games that are definitely coming but as a film. it's much less a film and more a 90-minute advert for Ninendo's Mario franchise. We get the platformer, Mario Kart (complete with the drift boost), a nod to Luigi's Mansion, Donkey Kong...",

Overall, the film appears to be entertaining and worth watching, but not without its flaws.",

        content: "The director wanted authenticity, and there are elements of this throughout, but none more than the fact the whole film was also shot in Comanche in parallel.\n\nWe meet our protagonist, Naru. She's got intricate eye makeup and is practising throwing an axe into a tree with her dog. (the dogs nearby it's not helping with the target practice) Then she spots a deer track and follows it, but a noise startles the deer, and she chases it through the forest with some parkour, her dog doing some solid herding until it's trapped by a steel trap, that she unfastens easily.\n\nShe tries to figure the trap out and half-heartedly bashes it with a rock, then wanders off after healing her dog with some magic dirt. Coco, the canine actor, is not a trained actor at all, as the director wanted authenticity, and so the breed is one from this history of Native American tribes. It's quite nice seeing a dog be a dog wandering off camera a bit and grinning rather than a perfect robot. However, it can be a little jarring when the cast is going for seriousness, and the pup is leaping up to play.\n\nWe're introduced to the Predator early, in its camo armour, with its ship flying off. We're expected to know from our meta experience that the Predator is here to hunt the most dangerous game in the universe. Humans!\n\nNaru wants to be a hunter, like the men of the tribe, and her brother supports her (somewhat) due to her tracking skills, though our evidence of this was spotting massive hoofprints and a deer two meters away, so maybe this tribe's bar is just really low?\n\nAll the hunters hold their bowstrings strangely; given the insistence on canine accuracy, I assume this is also how Native Americans used their bows, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe hunters are hunting a lion, not realising they intern are being hunted by a Predator! Perhaps, soon, the hunter will become the hunted? Does the predator become the Prey? The obvious play on words becomes explicit, perhaps?\n\nThe landscapes are just gorgeous.\n\nThe lion in the dark is primal and scary. Naru's knocked unconscious escaping, but her brother staggers back to the fire with the lion's head and blood all over his face. It's taxed him to the limit. High on his success he boldly announces he can defeat anything out there and crushes his sister's dreams of joining the Hunters as she tried but had to be carried back and couldn't bring it home. It's impossible not to think of how this conversation will play out in reverse with the Predator. Or how much he has done exactly what the Predator is on Earth to do.\n\nWe get a grizzly ready to eat Naru, and her dog uses himself as bait to lure the bear off, He's a good dog! Trapped in a beaver dam with its teeth inches away from her all goes quiet until the bear and Predator fight it's a good tense scene and it's not clear the Predator is going to win (Which would be a hilarious end to the film) until he does and holding the carcass above himself, the predator gets revealed in true invisible man style by getting covered in blood.\n\nYou cannot fault the bravery of the Hunters, they see the Predator's face, see it shrug off an arrow or two and still attach. You can fault their intelligence. Naru legs it after she sees it slaughter basically everyone she knows. She's smarter than they were.\n\nWe meet the owners of the bear trap. Do you remember that from the start, the other bit of anachronistic tech and the only thing that really gave us a clue when this was taking place? They're scumbag French Trappers who use Naru & her brother as bait. Don't get attached.\n\nNaru's the only one thinking about how the Predator is behaving and what that means, but the Trappers do a pretty good job of knocking it down and getting a net over it. Then things fall apart for them. One of the trappers back away when the odd little box starts bleeping. The others get closer. Naru has left by this point to rescue her dog from the rest of the Trappers. She saves the Predator a trip by killing them all herself.\n\nPredator isn't doing so great, he's sealing himself back up where he's been cut and stabbed.\n\nPredator stamps on a wounded captive of the French and then stabs him when he screams, it's not very on brand given he's not typically targeting non-threats.\n\nThe wirework for her brother arriving is terrible, which is a shame as the action to this points been really good, but he makes up for it in the close combat. Her brother knows that means he's not going any further. He tells his sister, \"Bring it Home\" and distracts Predator for her to vanish.\n\nShe tricks the Predator by arming one of the remaining trappers with a powderless gun, and he goes in for the kill, shoots him in the back of the head and grabs his mask. It's pretty great, but she is just standing there with the gun, and whilst I get the message of underestimating women, it seems unlikely an Alien hunter species would do that given it's a peculiarity of Humanity sociology.\n\nPredator no longer takes her as non-threatening, and is doing a pretty good job of beating her up, though she takes his arm off.\n\nCoco saves the day. Bringing her her trusty axe, Naru uses its cord to pull him into the quicksand she fell into earlier. The rise from the mud is pretty tense. Then we discover this Predator is a card-carrying half-wit as he forgot the targeting device was on his helmet and she set that up, pointing at him. It's really nicely done but does require the Predator to be carrying the idiot ball for it to work.\n\nShe returns to her tribe, covered in glowing green blood and carrying a dismembered Predators head. They take her seriously that maybe they should move on.\n\nIts a solid horror/action movie; Naru carries the entire film, and almost everyone else is forgettable. Almost everyone but Coco.",

        content: "One of the most obvious notes, coming off the TikTok trends is this film is not Wes as a parody of himself as he arguably becomes with his most recent films. The combination of his signature style and budget means he has had a tendency to over-emphasise the symmetry and pastel shades he's known for. Whilst these things are present in Royal Tannenbaums, they are not overpowering, but rather a subtle thread woven through.\n\nSet in a New York that seems permanently constrained to the 1970s, the film follows a famous New York family, royalty in the way America does royalty, through celebrity which becomes notoriety over time, as opposed to the UK's more traditional approach of selecting a single family and ensuring the only marry their cousins until inbreeding brings drama faster than their chins disappear.\n\nThe three children are all prodigies of a sort, a playwright, a tennis star and a genius for business. Each brings the personal peculiarity you expected from Anderson to the table and as we meet them again in late adulthood their eccentricity has become complete dysfunction. The fourth child, a neighbour follows their path to dysfunction, but as a side character lacks the immunity from the consequences a family of American Royalty has.\n\nThe cast is outstanding, Paltrow before she went completely off the deep end of steamed vaginas and alkaline water with acidic lemon and bone broth, both Wilson brothers, Stiller in one of his rare non-comedic roles he should do more of, Gene Hackman channelling his Luthor and the best Morticia Addams we've ever had Anjelica Huston.\n\nThe case and script do big emotions, played small. The whole thing is very WASP and big on awkwardness, so much so, it sometimes feels British in the unlikableness of the characters.\n\nArrested Development is if the Royal Tannenbaums was filmed by cops - Jason bateman\nAnderson plays with abrupt cuts, making the transitions jarring and sudden, a visible difference from the common smoothing we often see in feature films.\n\nIt's mild and silly as a film until it isn't, an approach Anderson describes as very much his style, perhaps more than the symmetry and pastel colours, is the sudden shift from the quiet to the loud. Richie's suicide attempt comes almost from nowhere, we're conditioned to see a dramatic haircut as both cathartic and cleansing and we assume we know where things are going because we see so little of the real emotions of the characters around us, repressed and hidden, they suddenly rise to the surface and in a red river flow to the drain.\n\nThe callousness of the Tannenbaums for those not 'of them' is evident in the waiting room, the boy who is the subject of psychological evaluation and experimentation is left to sit in his bloody t-shirt after finding Richie. No one thinks to engage or offer him new clothing.\n\nRichie leaves the hospital and finds his adoptive sister in his childhood tent, there is poignance and hopelessness in his childhood tent. they acknowledge their shared feelings and their shared sense nothing can happen, despite there being no real reason other than their perception to the constraints they feel.\n\nAfter a dramatic car crash, where Stiller's children are just barely saved from death by Hackman, there is an off-beat Monty Python chase through the hotel. In a tiny nod to Stiller's ongoing references to his workouts, he easily vaults a wall that later a soldier struggles to even scale.\n\nOne of Anserson's more grounded films, it's a very strong story of a family that fell apart years before they admitted it, who spent a decade or two going through the motions, without ever going beneath the surface.\n\nOther Thoughts\nColour-matching Ambilights add a lot to a Wes Anderson film given his use of colour and saturation.\n\nWhen you close your eyes, it's impossible to tell if it's Luke or Owen speaking.",

        aiSummary: "Based on the review provided, this movie seems to be an odd mix of humor, absurdity, and action, with a somewhat disjointed plot. The reviewer found some parts of the movie funny, but it may not be the best choice for someone looking for a serious or coherent film. This score indicates that the movie is somewhat entertaining but may not be universally appealing or particularly memorable.",
        tagline: "It's a movie about a bear doing cocaine and it's based on \"True Events\". This may be all the review you need. p.s. I found it funny.",
        content: "We get some advice on surviving a black bear attack set against clouding landscape shots and sporadic plinks of notes. They then tell us this vital information on survival is from Wikipedia.\n\nTwo hippies are camping out, rather he's German (ish, American film accents are hit or miss) and a hippie and she's his fiance along for the ride. he's lecturing about how exactly is a state, not a drug. She might be German, but the actress definitely isn't. ( googled and she's Dutch)\n\nThey step over a massive bear footprint. Honestly, it has a puddle of water in it, it's bigger than the one in Jurassic Park. This bear better be 5 meters tall.\n\nThe fiance says \"I've always wanted to see a bear in real life, we have such good luck in nature.\" and they take photos of it. He's a bit more sensible.\n\nHe says 'Fight it!' she says 'Fuck that for a game of soldiers you daft bugger\" and legs it. Remender kids, you don't need to be faster than a bear, you need to be faster than your fiance, She was! Except he fell over and the bear just leap over him and ate her. He gets to keep her leg though as a present.\n\nCOCAINE BEAR!\n\nIt chases a poorly CGI'd butterfly and ignores the German guy.\n\nWoah! I feel old now, we get a few anti-drug commercials from my youth.\n\nWe basically get a bunch of groups of people, loosely connected. So I'm going to tell you about them separately.\n\nSyd\nWe meet Syd, the big bad drug dealer who lost the coke. He looks kinda like a bear himself. Turns out his son was involved in the 'business' and his daughter-in-law Joan is dead. He feels teh son in law should be a)over it and b)back on drugs by now. Charming fellow. He's looking after his grandson and is kinda sick of it. He sends his, we assume, right-hand man to bring his son-in-law back into the fold.\n\nSyd's played by Ray Liotta. I assumed he was dead.\n\nSyd kinda turns up near the end with a rifle and shoots the police officer. In the time between shooting the officer and going to investigate the officers gave all 14,000,000 USD of coke to the bear.\n\nTurns out his partner Reba was on the take. It would be a bigger emotional reveal if we got more than 30 seconds with her at the start. She was so inconsequential this is the first you heard of her after all.\n\nSyd's the only one left in the cave, not wanting to get his coke wet. He gets strangled by the bag he refused to leave behind by the bear. It's supposed to be deep. it's deeply stupid.\n\nRanger Liz, Peter and Sari\nYou'll know the actress, Margo Martindale, she's been in a lot. To the point Bojack Horseman makes fun of it.\n\nShe chats to a hiker in very 70's gear who does a bit of mild shoplifting but wins her over with some flattery about her perfume. The reason for her wearing the perfume arrives with a cardboard Smokie the Bear, basically oblivious to the romantic interest of the Ranger. Peter's played by the guy who played Mitchell in Modern Family.\n\nA concerned woman, Sari, arrives looking for her daughter. The ranger, the gent and her head out. The ranger oversells us on the danger of the local gang. the Doochamps.\n\nThey spot Henry up a tree, DeeDee is nowhere to be found.\n\nPeter doesn't like to call animals animals, he calls them friends. Shortly after this reveal, he gets mauled, a little. The Ranger also gets a little mauled. They all climb trees. Peter remarks that of course bears can climb trees. They all wonder why they are up there.\n\nI think we're supposed to find this bit tense and nerve-racking. But everyone has been so annoying so far, and the bear has been so ineffective at attacking Americans that we're really not worried. The bear ignores Sari and climbs up after Henry. Peter pats all the cocaine off himself for some stupid reason and gets eaten due to the delicious cocaine aroma.\n\nOr rather his leg gets eaten off. Same as the German woman. That's really unpleasant, but I'm not sure it's instantly fatal like it seems to be.\n\nDoochamps\nThe Doochamps are a trio of incredibly sleazy, scrawny and ineffective muggers. One was the shoplifter who talked to the ranger. They decide to mug our huge drug dealer Davdeed, who's decked out in gold and is clearly massive. It goes exactly as well for them as you expect. They get the ever-loving shit kicked out of them. He gets a bit stabbed, but not seriously. The Doochamps have found at least one parcel of coke. Eddie and Daveed interrogate one of them and take him off to get the rest of the coke they buried.\n\nThe two remaining Doochamps decide to re-rob the ranger station despite being walking bruises. They get caught doing it by the Ranger. They see a bear outside, sat all cute. The Ranger accidentally kills one of the Doochamps, the other one is covered in his brain. The bear just kinda leaves. Then comes back to maul the face of a Doochamp.\n\nDetective Bob Springs\nThe stereotyped black police Detective ended up with a fancy dog when he wanted a man's best friend type, it felt a bit scattergun in their attempts to make all these people interesting and quirky.\n\nHe arrives after some of the groups have already been mauled and/or maimed. But somehow misses everything. He finds the gazebo a long time before everyone else and sees the bag that's been stashed.\n\nThey really really want him to say \"I'm too old for this shit\" but can't quite get him to. He gets the drop on Daveed from his position on top of the Gazebo and later shoots Daveed (and shoots off two of his fingers) when Daveed tries to grab his gun back.\n\nThe bear shows up, whilst he's still on the Gazeebo roof. After an altercation with Eddie, he's the only smart one and uses the coke to lure the bear away. But there is a standoff between him and Daveed, a standoff ended by Syd's rifle.\n\nHe at least gets a chuckle when Syd's crew all head off towards \"an Apex Predator, high on cocaine\"\n\nEddie & Daveed\nSyd's son, Eddie is sad and got a tattoo to commemorate his wife, but the tattooist was illiterate and wrote John. He's depressed. even his Penne (weirdly pronounced Peneeee) is plain. Daveed draggs him out of his depressed bar funk and into a depressed car funk. He and Daveed are driving through the countryside, listening to Wings of Love, which is making Eddie cry again. He thinks Syd might have killed his wife. Via giving her cancer. It's stupid.\n\nEddie & Daveed, after capturing a Doochamp, make him take them to where he buried the rest of the coke. Daveed wants to just get this shit done with. Eddie and the Doochamp decide to play 20 questions. I'd have smacked them both.\n\nWe get a great dream scene where the one remaining Doochamp imagines he and his crew are moving to NY City. One is holding his head in his arms. The others were covered in blood. Eddit and the Doochamp hug. They're too late too get the drugs.\n\nDuring the bear's appearance at the gazebo, it collapses unconscious on top of Eddie. They think it might be dead. It isn't. For some reason Daveed puts his ear to it, rather than, shooting it through the eye. The bear manages to eat the entire parcel of coke instead of bothering them, then molests Eddie a bit.\n\nAfter his arrival and somewhat forcible recruitment of them both, Syd drags them into the bear's cave, and they gather up the remaining coke. Reba leaves as Syd's wants to keep exploring the park to find more coke. I assume Syd's one of those 100% completionists in video games too.\n\nSyd gets harassed by the bear cubs and accidentally throws his gun to Sari. They use that as a way to escape and jump off Chekov's cliff.\n\nReba gives the Detective's dog to Eddie. It seems to solve all his emotional issues. The dog eats Daveeds missing fingers.\n\nHenry & DeeDee\nTwo young kids are out hiking. I'm 90% sure this is the start of a Stephen King book. One carrying a rifle. This being America it may be an actual rifle or a BB Gun. Impossible to tell. They find a parcel of coke. Luckily they've been paying attention to the anti-drug lectures and so they immediately recognise it. Henry bullshits his way about having done coke before. The girl tells him to do it again, and they entirely cut the bag open. She then takes a full-on mouthful of the powder, and so does he. They also find a half-empty packet. They think its a deer. We know its a guy in a bear suit. Wait, sorry, no, a scary bear that they definitely had the budget to have in every scene.\n\nWhen they do give you a full visual of the bear it's pretty good, all foamy faced. It sneezes on the kids and they run away.\n\nDuring his wandering with Sari, they find the German hiker, Olaf. He's sitting out crying about his wife. Henry helps himself to some food.\n\nSari's finds the bear's lair with the help of Olaf who waits outside, gifting them a small flashlight. She brings Henry with her. I think this woman's an idiot. Inside the cave DeeDee's just been hanging out with a few baby bears who are so covered in coke they \"look like polar bears\" We get the most insanely huge cliff and waterfall. It's Chekov's waterfall. Saying it now.\n\nAnd it was. Sar, DeeDee, Henry, Daveed and Eddie all leap safely into the water from this huge cliff and escape.\n\nThe Ambulance Crew!\nThe ambulance people arrive and try and deal with all the blood and fatalities. it does not go well for them, it's comical rather than terrible. The two ambulance people and Ranger Liz manage to get in the ambulance and drive away.\n\nThe bear chases the ambulance, catches it, even with Liz shooting at it, and eats the male Ambulance drives hand, the driver panics hits a tree and flies through the windscreen. it's hilarious!\n\nPost Credits:\nThe dog eats Daveeds fingers\n\nThe Doochamp kid, Stache, who survived managed to get the duffle full of coke. he hitches a lift with a farmer and his sheep. Stache changes his mind about leaving the coke in the back with the animals.\n\nFinal thoughts\nA much better real-life (ish) film of the crazy white people getting eaten by bears is Grizzly Man by Werner Hertzog. But that's serious rather than funny. If you've got 90 minutes to kill and you want to turn your brain off, give it a go.",
