        aiSummary: "tldr: James Gunn breathes fresh, colourful life into Superman, delivering the hopeful hero Snyder never could, complete with perfectly snarky Lois, a petty genius Lex, and a hilariously awkward accidental allegory on immigration and geopolitical invasions. It's exactly the fun reboot DC desperately needed.",
        tagline: "I'm glad Snyder is still alive to see this film and see how fully, fundamentally and totally he failed as a screenwriter, director, and person.",
        content: "All in all, this was the hopeful superman we all wanted and haven't seen on the big screen in a couple of decades. The colour pallet was cheerful in the right places, and whilst it perhaps lacked some of Snyders visual beauty, it more than overcame that with just getting the tone right.\n\nIt's a very James Gunn film, so there's quips and sillyness, there are minor characters who are very different from their comic counterparts, but unlike Snyder they are still respected. An example is the use of the Engineer as a Lex soldier. This takes away her agency by having him be the mastermind of the nano-machines which is disappointing. In the comics she does this herself and joins the ruthless Authority. (Though the universe merge of the Authority and DC never really made sense to me)\n\nLex was amazing, the pettiness and general insanity are fantastic. His storage unit of people who have slighted him is chef's kiss. It's the first time in a long time we're seeing the Lex who plans and who's power is so great he can stand toe to toe with Superman, shielded by his intelligence and his ruthlessness.\n\nDavid was great as both Clark & Superman and it was brilliant to see a film start mid-universe not with the origin stories.\n\nLois is great and her pinning Clark to the wall over and over again in their interview was hilarious and the reason she is Pulizer winning and he tends to get it for his novels not his journalism.\n\nMr Terrific was great, though the Mobius Chair look is odd. Guy Gardner is top tier.\n\nGary was great. Justice for Gary.\n\nCool to see such a good use of Metamorpho, including his flying head. It's a shame we'll never get to his partner's appearance in Sandman because Gaiman 'allegedly' can't keep it in his pants.\n\nKrypto is a very good boi.\n\nIts weird we got the Boy's ending/twist that we never got in the Boys. Like it was very obvious from the moment we saw Ultraman's outfit what was coming, but it was a weird choice, like Gunn accidentally copied from the wrong material.\n\nThere's also two plot elements that are really blown up by recent events and I'm not sure either could have been planned due to the time it takes to produce a movie.\n\nSuperman gets arrested by ICE for being an immigrant.\n\nJames Gunn having to come out and insist his invasion in the desert of white europeans led by a traitorous warmonger with an eastern European accent against an oppressed brown population in poverty but who are called terrorists so the invaders can steal the land is not about Isreal and Palestine and all the above is just some weird coincidence is.... something.\n\nA promising start to DC's umpteenth reboot.",

        tagline: "There's magic in Wicked, but it's buried under layers of inconsistent tone, pacing issues, and a runtime that feels as long as the Yellow Brick Road.",
        content: "I, like many people, have been holding space for the lyrics of defying gravity and for this review.\n\nElphaba's mother had an affair with the Wizard. I'm not sure if we're supposed to know that at this stage or if he's supposed to be a mysterious stranger, but its very obviously Jeff Goldblum.\n\nThe parents are strangely horrified by Elphaba being born with green skin given they have a wolf for a midwife and a bear for a nurse.\n\n\"It's alright little one, he shouldn't have blamed you\" Child Elphaba is told by a random bear. Even though she did the thing she was blamed for.\n\nGlinda goes full wickerman on a statue of Elphaba as the townspeople cheer and dance.\n\nThe bubble is fantastic, beautifully done, slightly wobbly and when it pops there's a very subtle rainbow in the air. Love it very much.\n\nThe framing of Wicked is a random townsperson asks Glinda if it was true she was Elphaba's friend on her way out of the village and basically Glinda decides to info dump. Good for us, the audience, probably a pretty frustrating afternoon for the townspeople who had other things to do than sit through five hours of the Good Witch waxing lyrical about her school days.\n\nGlinda goes full Plastic with her 'Blick' and \"strangers are just people I've never met\"\n\nThe students at Shiz are also shocked, horrified and pitying of the girl with green skin. They are completely unphased by the two professors who are talking animals.\n\nWe're told by the staff that true magic is increasingly rare. Naturally Elphaba, who's only supposed to be giving Nessarose assistance to her room gets annoyed and does her levitating trick. Madam Morrible claims credit to keep things quiet, fast tracks her into the school, and plans to privately tutor her. Galinda's horrified that she, for once, hasn't got her way.\n\nThe section of the Wizard and I where she sings about 'de-greenify' is beautifully shot with light coming through spinning coloured glass changing her skin tone through a rainbow.\n\nI think we're supposed to think Galinda's being unfair by only giving a little space to Elphaba in her room, but honestly she was railroaded into having a roommate in her room. She's been reasonably decent about the whole thing and Elphaba's got a pretty big chip on her shoulder about the whole thing for someone who wasn't supposed to be at that school twenty minutes ago. One of the challenges is Ariana Grande is such a likeable person, it carries over to Galinda and its hard to separate it.\n\nGalinda ramps up the mean girl nastiness in front of the animal professor of history and also asks some profoundly stupid questions. \"Poppy's are my favourite, they keep me cheerful in these dark times\" is a doubly cutting comment from the depressed Goat given their medicinal use and their symbolism.\n\nElphaba follows Dr Dilamond and listens in to his private conversations with his friends. He's pretty unfazed by her breach of basic decency. Animals are losing the ability to speak. This is a bit of a horrifying thing to have as a B plot.\n\nFirst Elphaba and then Galinda meet the charming rogue of our story, who is unbothered by Galinda's skin colour and leads the students in a big dance number. His name's Fiyero. He's a student at Shiz. Even though Cynthia and Ariana are hardly school age, this guy gives strong \"How do you do fellow kids\" or the elderly Luke Perry in 90210. The actor is closer to forty than thirty, his child would be a more appropriate age to attend Shiz. Perhaps he is a mature student.\n\nThe roommate scene was already very close to the roommates scene in Wednesday. We then get a very very similar dancing movements from Elphaba at the ball. Galinda, feeling like a pretty terrible person for her behaviour (as Elphaba got her into the sorcery program) mimics her weird crazy person dancing. Ariana manages to bring a certain grace to the odd movements, but Elphaba continues looking like a puppet with an ungainly puppeteer.\n\nThe girls share some secrets and Galinda love bombs the hell out of \"Elphie\". Given no one other than a Goat and an elderly student has ever shown Elphaba even the most basic human kindness this is extremely effective. We then get one of the best songs in the show, Popular.\n\nThe animal Professor tells us it's his last day, and that animals will no longer be allowed to teach. Immediately after that he's dragged off campus by the police. Its a bit weird. I'd honestly have cut the bit with him saying they were not able to speak any more.\n\nApparently 'cages' are a new innovation in Oz. (Which must make it very easy to escape from an Oz prison.) It (rightly) pisses off Elphaba so much she uses her magic to put everyone but Fiyero into an opium induced sleep. Fiyero breaks the cub out of the cage without hesitation. His characterisation is basically Charlie \"Wild Card\" Kelly at this point, its deeply inconsistent. Fiyero questions why he was the only one she didn't effect with the spell, I'd just assumed it was because unlike the other students he's developed a tolerance to opioids due to his many, many, decades of life.\n\nElphaba is summoned to the Wizard, and brings Galinda (now Glinda in solidarity of Dr Dilamond). As they explore the city we're treated to Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth on stage vying for attention on stage during a retelling of the Wizards arrival.\n\nWe get the \"I am Oz the great and terrible\" and then Jeff comes out to say hello and do some very terrible up close magic for us. The Wizard does to Glinda what she did to Boq at the start, calling her Balinda. He's basically playing Grandmaster or Zeus from his more recent outings. All Ego driven generosity. He's pretty much Glinda all grown up.\n\nThe Grimmerie is a deeply inconvenient shape for a book. There's a reason we use rectangles. It's a bit 'different just to be different' honestly. But Elphie casts a spell, as the Wizard and Morrible planned, granting wings to their monkey guards. Elphaba figures out the Wizards a fraud and all his magic is fake.\n\nMorrible rallies the flying monkeys to chase Elphaba telling them \"she did this\" maybe its just me, but if someone gave me giant cool wings that let me fly I'd not be angry and chasing them down, I'd be protecting them. Wings would be AMAZING!\n\nGlinda kills a guy. He's grabbed her leg as they try and escape in the Wizards balloon, and she hits him with a sandbag. he then falls maybe 3 stories to land spine first on a wooden floor.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba face off, and then we get Wicked's best song. I hate to say it, but Cynthia's third for me, after seeing Idina on stage in London and (don't judge me!) Kurt & Rachel face off in Glee.\n\nWith hat and cloak from Glinda, Grimmarie from the wizard and broom by her own craft Elphaba defies gravity.\n\nWorth noting the guards are useless. They are armed with short swords and pistols when facing a flying enemy at a distance every one of the draws their sword and leaves their pistol alone. There would be no sequel if even one guard had been trained.\n\nThe film does suffer from being way too long. Its 2h 40 mins and that's only half of the total film. Its been split in two. The first film is already longer than the stage adaption.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: Miyazaki's latest film is a weird rollercoaster of war orphans, family drama, giant birds, and magical nonsense wrapped in Ghibli's trademark charm. The animation is stunning, but starting to feel dated against newer anime powerhouses (Demon Slayer says hi). The story is packed with odd choices, like a morally questionable dad, creepy herons, and some wildly unhinged plot twists that are both hilarious and head-scratching. The English dub flaunts A-list names, but their performances don't hold a candle to seasoned voice actors. It's bizarrely personal and familiar in that classic Miyazaki way, but it lacks the fresh magic of his best work.",
        tagline: "Miyazaki is never bad, but this film reuses too many of his staples to truly be great.",
        content: "Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and naturally produced by Studio Ghibli, this was the film Miyazaki came out of retirement (again) to direct before retiring (again) upon its completion.\n\nIt starts with common Miyazaki themes: a young boy affected by a war, an incomplete family moving out of a city to a new home in the countryside. In this case, it's so his father can hook up with his dead wife's sister. Like much of Miyazaki's work, the father is absent from much of the film. But given that he's apparently a scumbag, that's perhaps for the best.\n\n\"I'm going to be your new mother from now on. Sound good?\" is an unhinged thing to say to your war-orphan nephew. Having him feel the baby move and telling him it's a new sister or brother immediately had me rooting against this woman and the philandering father.\n\nThe artwork is, of course, impeccable, but the approach and style are showing their age compared to newer anime like Demon Slayer.\n\nJust after they arrive at his new home, and his father's new factory is pointed out in the distance, we see the grey heron for the first time. It flies inside the home briefly, and we're told it's unusual. His new home is expansive, richly appointed, and weirdly similar to the house in one season of Tenchi Muyo! He doesn't live in it, though. He stays in a more regular house nearby.\n\nWe're introduced to a gaggle of potato-faced old women who are all about three feet tall. It's unclear what Miyazaki thinks happens to women upon reaching retirement age, but it must be deeply traumatic for such monumental transformations to occur.\n\nThe boy has a horrifying dream of his mother burning alive and ascending...somewhere. He is running through the flames. Later, the heron leads him to a tower, which he's told was built by his grandmother's uncle, who apparently read too many books and lost his mind. Remember, kids, reading is BAD!\n\nHe gets into a fight at school, but apparently deciding it wasn't serious enough, he bashes his own head in with a rock until blood flows freely down his face. It's weird. He does such a severe job of it that a doctor needs to visit and do stitches. It's also weird when his father says he will get vengeance against whichever child did this to his flesh and blood. Luckily, things get more normal when the heron arrives and says the boy's name a few times.\n\nThe boy heads out with a rattan to confront the heron. It snaps the wooden sword easily with its beak full of human teeth and tells him his mother is not dead. Then there's a chorus of fish and frogs swarming over him, saying, \"Join us, join us!\" His mother-aunt shoots an arrow at the heron and drives the creatures away.\n\nAfter some faffing around, a bit of petty larceny, and some time sharpening a knife, he crafts a bow like his aunt's but from bamboo. It's useless because it's bamboo. He's lucky it hasn't snapped already. He fletches the arrow with a heron feather. He also seems to eat a lot of glue in the process, which explains a few things. The heron feather arrow is magically good.\n\nHe stalks through the forest with one of the potato women, who tries to stop him from going into the tower. He is aware the claim that his mother is alive is a lie and admits he's not that bothered about rescuing his aunt. He just needs confirmation on his mother and is willing to risk the trip. It's pretty hilarious how indifferent he is about his aunt.\n\nThere's a creepy man inside the heron. He's much less threatening once his costume is damaged. He does give off pedophile vibes. The boy then sinks through the floor into a new world, where a pirate saves him from a flock of pelicans at the gates of a graveyard.\n\nWe get a moment typical of a Miyazaki film, a gaggle of tiny, cute creatures! These look exactly like the Adipose from Doctor Who.\n\nThe boy is stoic. There's no other word for it. Despite the strangeness and terror he's facing, he stands firm before it, his voice and demeanor never wavering. It's a common trope in anime for young men.\n\nThere is much akin to Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away in his exploration of this new world, but with more outhouses.\n\nWe cut back to the 'real' world, where the boy's father stops his factory workers from continuing to search for his pregnant sister-in-law/wife and his son so they don't fall behind schedule. I'm assuming he knows of a third sister he can hook up with.\n\nHe meets Himi. She's made of fire and says Nasuko is her sister. I'm sure the fire is just a coincidence to how the boy's mum burned alive. She info-drops that the tower can straddle all different kinds of worlds. We move on, no further questions. We can be sure she's a monster because she puts butter in between the bread and jam for him. He opens up to Himi that his mother's dead. She cheerfully says, \"Mine too!\" No further questions are asked there either.\n\n\"Be careful; in here there are limits to what my power can do,\" Himi tells him in the corridor of doors (a very Midkemia Hall of Worlds reference), which is a terrifying thing to say when you pause and think about it, because it implies there are no limits to her power normally.\n\nThey release an army of giant birds into the real world through the door. The father chops at them with a sword, and then they turn into budgies. The father appears to be slowly losing his mind. Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.\n\nHimi waits until he's electrocuted to tell him not to touch the stone. She's a little bit of a bitch, tbh. He finds his aunt, and she tells him to leave and that she hates him.\n\nThe boy meets his great-granduncle, the tower master. His uncle is playing with children's blocks piled up as a tower. By this point, the boy is dressed like John McClane in Die Hard. The uncle, who would have been a 19th-century Japanese architect, is wearing a black robe adorned with a necklace of turquoise gems, hair that would put Einstein to shame, and a mustache greater even than Sam Elliott's. So he either always was an odd fish, or since joining the tower, gave himself a makeover. The uncle puts a heavy burden on the boy and tells him it's his responsibility to choose which block will be used in his toy tower.\n\nThe boy then wakes up chained to a wall in the budgies' kitchen, only to be rescued by the creepy heron-man. They sneak out of the way comically easily.\n\nAfter a deep conversation with his granduncle, he returns to his world, turning down the chance to create a world of his own. After King Birdman destroys the building blocks and the granduncle starts to die, he tells the boy to run. The boy doesn't even hesitate. He grabs Himi and sprints off, leaving his granduncle to his (well-deserved) fate. The tower collapses. Turns out Himi is his mother! (shock!) and she has to go through a different door. The boy's calling his aunt \"mother\" now for some reason. Seems like a bit of a slap in the face to his actual mother, who's standing right next to him.\n\nThe large birds follow them out the door and turn into small budgies as before. They shit all over the aunt, who giggles, saying, \"So cute.\" It's weird. Everyone kind of arrives together, and the film ends.\n\nThe film is strange and odd in that very special Ghibli way. You forgive the peculiarities because they come with such charm. It's not his most groundbreaking work, but somehow, it's one of his most personal, reflecting his own childhood. In feeling, if not in giant birds filled with men. My opinion of it is colored, I think, by my initial impression of the father and aunt hooking up and having a baby together more or less on the bones of the boy's mother. It's hard to root for her being saved.\n\nThe voice actors for the English dub are very high profile: Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Willem Dafoe, Christian Bale. But a continuing trend of hiring famous actors to do voice work rather than professional voice actors shows.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: This movie is a low-budget, high-concept gem where all the action happens in one dude's house. John Oldman casually drops a bombshell to his friends: he's a 14,000-year-old Cro-Magnon who's hung out with history's VIPs, from Buddha to Van Gogh, and—plot twist—claims to have inspired Jesus. The group debates whether he's a fraud or the real deal, but the story stays just convincing enough to mess with your head. No flashy effects here, just one actor absolutely carrying the film. The ending sneaks up on you with an emotional gut-punch that's both abrupt and effective.",
        tagline: "A surprisingly engaging movie with an unusual premise.",
        content: "It was TikTok that introduced me to this movie, its all-knowing algorithm presenting clips it knew I'd enjoy.\n\nThe entire film is staged in a couple of rooms in John Oldman's house and a little outside by his truck. It's a film where almost nothing happens except one struggle over a gun and a medical emergency. Every other moment is John telling his life story—or telling a wild, fantastical tale.\n\nJohn tells his circle of friends he is a Cro-Magnon man, 14,000 years old. Every ten years or so, he moves so no one notices he doesn't age. His friends, colleagues from the university he teaches at, naturally don't believe him at first and challenge him over and over again.\n\nThey, like us, begin to wonder though—the story hangs together, it makes sense, though he has managed to meet a great many of the most famous people in history. He studied with Buddha. He had the chance to sail with Columbus (but was still slightly concerned there was an edge to the world). He has a Van Gogh painting given to him by the artist. Until one asks if he's ever been a religious figure. It takes some pushing, but he admits he was the basis for Jesus. His most religious friend calls it blasphemy. He simply claims he tried passing on some of Buddha's teachings and then a lot of extra things were attributed to him in the texts.\n\nThe movie ends a little abruptly, with him mentioning where he was ten years before and dropping a name—a name that causes one of his friends to suffer a heart attack in sudden and complete certainty that he knew John's previous identity.\n\nThe cinematography is fine; it's a pretty simple setup, ordinarily lit but personal, as suits the premise. The whole film hangs on John's performance, and you're never quite sure if he's a playful liar trying to ease the sting of his sudden departure or a man deciding to be honest for the first time in an eon.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: In a world craving innovation, \"Wonka\" serves up a stale, half-baked confection. Timothée Chalamet, while easy on the eyes, falls short of the enigmatic chocolatier's legacy, delivering more of a petulant child than a master of confectionary wonders. Set against a backdrop that screams a confused homage to every popular franchise of the last two decades, this film meanders through a plot thinner than budget supermarket chocolate. The attempt to blend humour with a dark origin story leaves a taste as unsatisfying as sugar-free gum. It's a cinematic equivalent of finding a raisin in your chocolate bar - utterly disappointing.",
        tagline: "A prequel no one asked for and even fewer will remember.",
        content: "For some reason despite the outstanding 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the solidly mediocre 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory someone somewhere decided it was time for the Willy Wonka origin story no one asked for.\n\nStaring the androgynous, pixie-sized, youthful Timothée Chalamet as the titular Willy is a strange choice. He lacks the chaotic unsettling energy Depp brought to the role, let alone anything close to what Gene Wilder generated on screen.\n\nIn our first introduction to Wonka, he's a frighteningly naive, stupid child who is also generous and well-intentioned. A very different characterisation to other films where he is a near Loki-like character, a tricker with a gleam of malevolence. He won't hurt you, but he'll do a lot of things to tempt you to hurt yourself.\n\nHis ragged outfit which is a little large is very much the Artful Dodger,(even more so when he adopts his sidekick), making him seem very young. We're told Wonka's been on a sea voyage for 7 years. Chalamet's presence and performance make him perhaps 18, so he was a very young sailor. Or he's Chalamet's real age of nearly 30. Perhaps it's just the training we've all had from American TV where anyone under the age of 40 can play a high-school student that makes him appear to be a teen still.\n\nChalamet's American accent seems extremely out of place as a master chocolatier given America's terrible track record when it comes to chocolate. The extravagance of his creations is rather American, but people insist the chocolate also tastes good, so we must assume Wonka, like Chalamet is, at least half, French.\n\nThere's a huge influence from The Greatest Showman in this film's look. As well as Harry Potter. The opening of his store could easily be swapped with the Weasly Twin's store.\n\nChalamet is consistently aiming for Wilder or Depp in his performance but all I can see is Reese from Malcolm in the Middle. His outbursts are not terrifying or insane they are petulant. I think the issue is, without his Factory, without the environment of magic, wonder and danger he has created, everything Wonka says and does in the grimy London that surrounds him comes across as deranged rather than enchanting.\n\nIn a bizarre nod to the Depp film filmed in Munich and using a lot of local extras, the police are dressed in faux-German WW1 outfits rather than the British Bobbies you'd expect and certain names are very Germanic. Quite nicely, the three rival chocolatiers who confront Wonka in his red velvet code are dressed in primary colours, looking from above like they are a Roses Selection.\n\nWonka rescues a young black girl from a life of slavery. It's played for laughs. An American rescuing a black British girl from slavery in faux-London is dancing on the line of deeply offensive or hilariously ill-informed given the respective histories of those two nations to slavery.\n\nNoodle & Wonka sing a silly song whilst milking a Giraffe. Chalamet's voice is a pretty high key, Alto perhaps and Noodle's is higher, which makes the duet a little shrill. The music is lazy. Rather than creating rhymes, they lean heavily on just creating words. Moodle to rhyme with Noodle. This is a pretty consistent problem throughout the movie.\n\nThe wonder and needed nonsense ramps up finally when they decide to break into the cathedral of the chocoholic monks and the corrupt priest, it's just a shame this is right at the end. If I looked as young as Chalamet, I'd not be willing to sneak into a Catholic Church. Rowan Atkinson is, naturally, outstanding as the priest.\n\nThe drug cartel metaphor is both heavy-handed and lacking in execution. Which is an impressive fumble. Keegan-Michael Key does what he can with his growing addiction but it's also played straight for laughs.\n\nThe reveal is trite and predictable. The Death by Chocolate scene lacks impact given the fact Wonka later successfully uses exactly this sort of deranged approach to dealing with people he dislikes.\n\nChalamet attempts a touching rendition of Pure Imagination, but he misses the mark. Take a watch of the better version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVi3-PrQ0pY&ab_channel=beralts\n\nIt's unclear how Charlie later walks by this distant ruined castle on a daily basis.\n\nThe film was mediocre, which given how good many of the cast are is a little unforgivable. My footnote would be that Chalamet wasn't the actor for this role, he's not got the maniacal presence to bring the edge that Wonka needs. A stronger Wonka would have brought something this film desperately needed.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: \"The Marvels\" is like a cosmic joyride with a few flat tires along the way. Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan brings a nerdy enthusiasm that's as refreshing as finding an untouched slice of pizza the morning after a party. Monica's superhero landing needs work, and the Skrull sympathy play feels like trying to hug a cactus. The CGI swings from \"meh\" to \"passable,\" with a side of cat-rescue missions that make you question your life choices. Clocking in at a merciful 1h45m, \"The Marvels\" manages to entertain without needing to pause for a bathroom break, but it's more of a microwave dinner than a feast for the senses.",
        tagline: "Higher. Further. Faster.",
        content: "Iman carries the movie, her sheer enthusiasm shines through every scene. Her near stalker level insanity when talking to Captain Marvel is somehow endearing. \"I'm on a team with Captain Maaaaarveeeeel!!!\" Kamala's mum tells her 'no space adventures!' whilst she herself is in space is ace and very on brand for the character.\n\nIman is just a Ms. Marvel variant from Earth-1218, she's not acting, this is who she is.\n\nLooking at Kamala's face when she utters \"Oh captain, my captain!\" It's likely that Kamala's got some difficult conversations coming with her more conservative family members.\n\nThe absolute chaos of the first fight is fantastic.\n\nMonica being kinda useless in an emergency, or in space, or on an alien world; whether that's saving Kamala from falling to her death, noticing when Kamala wandered off to be heroic or ignoring Carol when she says not to do anything on the musical world (Side note, Kamala just vibing along in the background is awesome) is great as she's a scientist, not a soldier or a superhero. Normally we get a near-instant transition from people getting powers to them being incredible superheroes.\n\nIt remains hard to side with the Skrulls. I've got too much 616 bias to them. Bring in Reed and let them turn them into cows. This batch are incredibly whiney and self-righteous. Luckily we have very little exposure to them.\n\nKing Valkryie is great, but it really highlights how few good female characters Marvel actually put out that a bit-part character from a Thor film has become one of the bigger names. Don't get me wrong, Tessa Thompson is fantastic each time she's on screen, but the character's not a major player in the mainline Avengers or Thor canon. It's also a bit of a slap in the face how quickly they solve the Skrull housing issue given in Secret Invasion they spent years trying and failing for some reason.\n\nMonica is at least a black woman and Kamala is asian, entirely the wrong ethnicisty, but the continent is right I guess.\n\nI love that it's a Quantum Band, tying the Marvels back to Mah-Vel and Rick Jones. (Kamala insisting on calling it a bangle is funny as it really undercuts the seriousness when they demand it.) They spend a bit too much time talking about the science of this. And deciding that an inhabited planet is the best place for water when comets exist is a little daft. Or you know they have FTL, they've probably figured out how to combine a little hydrogen and oxygen. I know there's a reason, but it's a bad reason. They should separate revenge from survival and pursue them separately.\n\nThe 'training' montage to Intergalactic is great and it's nice seeing Kamala's enthusiasm infecting two typically stoic and dour characters. It also entertainingly shows Carol's agism, in that she chooses the adult with no experience and who's an amateur with their powers to prioritise on mission instead of the youth who's been a hero professionally and knows what to do.\n\nWhat's with hyper-advanced cultures using primitive weapons with a bit of added energy? The Wakandans do it, the singing people do it, the Kree do it...\n\nCarol's absolute lack of anything resembling subtlety in a fight is good, she's typically massively more powerful than anything around her, so a smash and bash is a rational approach, she's never had to learn more.\n\nThe cat-based rescue is stupid. The only saving grace is Kamala being made to do the collecting and being basically in tears about it. We never get an explanation as to why the scientists in Fury's space station are wearing Future Foundation jumpsuits.\n\nThe film is a fairly tight 1h45 minutes, which is great, we've been dealing with epic-length films for so long it's nice to find one that's keeping a good pace. The CGI isn't anything to write home about, but it's not as bad as some Marvel properties have been lately. They've also given Carol a bit more of an aligned look to the other two's powers and toned down the Dragonball Z from her first appearance.\n\nKamala recruiting Kate is great, we knew the Young Avengers was coming, but the fact she uses Fury's lines almost exactly means at some point Tony leaked the entire conversation publically, as no one else was there to hear it.\n\nThe Binary and Beast stinger is good for what it represents, but Beast's CGI is really bad and its not ideal this is the third variant we've seen of Monica's mother, it's a shame she was used in Doctor Strange as it would make the reveal hit harder if she wasnt.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: Welcome back, time-travelers, for another round of the Koyomi Takasaki multiverse lottery! If you've already consumed the blue pill, I mean, film, prepare yourself for the pink version of this animated trip. It's like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces constantly change, and the rules are written in 'pseudo-scientific' gobbledegook. Dad's house and the Imaginary Sciences Research Institute prove a slightly less enticing setting than the run-down mansion of movie one. But hey, maybe you're into that. If you've got the patience of a saint and the attention span of a quantum physicist, this film could be your cup of alternate reality tea.",

        content: "Also known as \"the Pink Film\" To Me, the One Who Loved You is one of the two films released simultaneously with an overlapping story of Koyomi Takasaki. The idea of these films is the experience for the viewer changes based on which order they watch the films in.\n\nWe watched \"To Every You I've Loved Before\" first, immediately followed by \"To Me, the One Who Loved You\"\n\nIt's hard to write my typical review of these two films without making watching them a lesser experience than it should be, so I'll avoid my typical point-by-point style and instead say I can see why your perspective of the outcomes of the story would be coloured by how you meet the characters and how you internalise their relationships. it's a clever mechanism, though not entirely unique. it's less 'choose your own adventure' and more Rashomon.\n\nTwo two films center around the idea of parrellel worlds, each created by choices people make. Trivial changes bring huge differences, Characters talk about them defined as a number of changes between \"0\" and where you end up. Both films lean heavily into pesudo-scientific langauge to explain the phenomenon, but suffer from a pretty fundemental gap. There are an infinity of \"universe 1\" for each change each person could have made, but in the films there are singular references. Broadly this doesnt matter, but its frustrating given how much attention is paid to the terminology used by the \"Imaginary Sciences\" teams.\n\nThe audio leans heavily into the surround sound, sometimes really well, like in a kareoke bar the music being behind you, and sometimes badly, where two people talking in a booth sound like they are at opposite ends of a tunnel.\n\nThe animation is inconsistent, some genuinly beautiful scenes and others with some poor proportions and lackluster movement. I suspect there was an A and a B team on these films with the transitional scenes being done by a cheaper animation studio.\n\nOur protagnoist, Koyomi Takasaki, makes a decision when he is 7 years old, whether he lives witih his mother or his father after their divorse, and his life diverges subtabtially from these points. To Me, the One Who Loved You follows him to his father's house and his second home in the Imaginary Sciences Research Institute.\n\nBoth films are an hour and forty long, so independantly they are quite short, but together as they need to be consumed its a long film.\n\nIt is worth a watch if you are a fan of anime, of alternate worlds and you don't mind having to pay a lot of attention to which characters are from what timeline. If you loved Primer then this is an easy to understand film. If you got lost watching Back to the Future you're pro=bably not going to enjoy this.\n\nThere's no right answers and a version of you will watch the films in each order so flip a coin and find out if you're in Universe 0 or 1.",

        aiSummary: "tldr: Alternate reality anime films for the multitaskers, mind-benders, and time-twisters among us. Bring your own navigation system and sense of humor as you embark on a journey through different timelines with Koyomi Takasaki, a teenager who's got more forks in his life road than a utensil drawer. It's a surround sound extravaganza with animation as wobbly as a drunken Picasso, but its quirky charm and concept might just reel you in.
