# Snarkflix Code Review - TODO List

## Reviews Needing Better Endings

### 1. ✅ Wolfwalkers (2020) - UPDATED
- **Issue**: Was too brief, only 1-min with bare-bones observations
- **Solution**: Expanded to 3-min read with:
  - Plot summary set in 1650 Kilkenny, Ireland
  - Character analysis (Robyn, Mebh, Bill, Lord Protector)
  - Technical innovation discussion (Wolfvision required new 3D animation)
  - Thematic analysis (industrialization vs. nature)
  - Proper conclusion tying everything together
  - Score remains 85 (appropriately reflects very positive review)


### 3. ✅ Black Widow (2021) - UPDATED
- **Issue**: Was too brief, ended with tangent about The Boys
- **Solution**: Expanded from 1-min to 4-min read with:
  - Plot summary and character analysis
  - Detailed cast performances (Pugh, Harbour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus)
  - Taskmaster criticism and Winter Soldier suggestion
  - Proper conclusion about Widow's final confrontation with Dreykov
  - Score raised from 65 to 72 to reflect the more positive tone

## Technical



### 6. Add Performance Monitoring (Low Priority)
- **File**: `script.js`
- **Action**: Add performance tracking
```javascript
// Track page load performance
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    const perfData = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
    console.log('Page load time:', perfData.loadEventEnd - perfData.loadEventStart);
});
```
