# Snarkflix Code Review - TODO List

## Reviews Needing Better Endings

### 1. Wolfwalkers (2020)
- **Issue**: Ends with "The magic representation is lovely. Well worth a watch." - Very brief, no real conclusion
- **Action**: Add proper analysis and conclusion tying together observations about animation style, storytelling, and overall impact


### 3. âœ… Black Widow (2021) - UPDATED
- **Issue**: Was too brief, ended with tangent about The Boys
- **Solution**: Expanded from 1-min to 4-min read with:
  - Plot summary and character analysis
  - Detailed cast performances (Pugh, Harbour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus)
  - Taskmaster criticism and Winter Soldier suggestion
  - Proper conclusion about Widow's final confrontation with Dreykov
  - Score raised from 65 to 72 to reflect the more positive tone

## Technical



### 6. Add Performance Monitoring (Low Priority)
- **File**: `script.js`
- **Action**: Add performance tracking
```javascript
// Track page load performance
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    const perfData = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
    console.log('Page load time:', perfData.loadEventEnd - perfData.loadEventStart);
});
```
