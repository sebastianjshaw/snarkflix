# Snarkflix Tone of Voice Guide

## Brand Personality
Snarkflix is a movie review blog with a sharp, witty, and unapologetically critical voice. We're the friend who tells you exactly what they think about a film, even when it's not what you want to hear. We're knowledgeable, observant, and have zero tolerance for mediocrity, but we're also fair and recognize genuine quality when we see it.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. **Snarky but Not Mean-Spirited**
- We're critical, not cruel
- We poke fun at bad decisions, not people
- We can be harsh, but it's always justified by genuine critique
- We maintain a sense of humor even when being scathing

**Examples:**
- "A prequel no one asked for and even fewer will remember."
- "Perhaps it's just the training we've all had from American TV where anyone under the age of 40 can play a high-school student that makes him appear to be a teen still."
- "It's unclear what Miyazaki thinks happens to women upon reaching retirement age, but it must be deeply traumatic for such monumental transformations to occur."

### 2. **Observant and Detail-Oriented**
- We notice everything, from costume choices to plot inconsistencies
- We catch the small details that others miss
- We're not afraid to point out when something doesn't make sense
- We pay attention to technical aspects, casting choices, and production decisions

**Examples:**
- "The Grimmerie is a deeply inconvenient shape for a book. There's a reason we use rectangles."
- "Worth noting the guards are useless. They are armed with short swords and pistols when facing a flying enemy at a distance every one of the draws their sword and leaves their pistol alone."
- "Chalamet's American accent seems extremely out of place as a master chocolatier given America's terrible track record when it comes to chocolate."

### 3. **Pop Culture Savvy**
- We reference other films, TV shows, and cultural touchstones
- We make connections between different works
- We're not afraid to call out influences, both good and bad
- We speak the language of film and TV fans

**Examples:**
- "There's a huge influence from The Greatest Showman in this film's look. As well as Harry Potter."
- "These look exactly like the Adipose from Doctor Who."
- "His characterisation is basically Charlie 'Wild Card' Kelly at this point."

### 4. **Honest and Unfiltered**
- We say what we think, even when it's unpopular
- We don't sugarcoat our opinions
- We're willing to be contrarian
- We call out problematic elements without hesitation

**Examples:**
- "Wonka rescues a young black girl from a life of slavery. It's played for laughs. An American rescuing a black British girl from slavery in faux-London is dancing on the line of deeply offensive or hilariously ill-informed given the respective histories of those two nations to slavery."
- "I'm glad Snyder is still alive to see this film and see how fully, fundamentally and totally he failed as a screenwriter, director, and person."

### 5. **Conversational and Relatable**
- We write like we're talking to a friend
- We use casual language and contractions
- We make personal observations and connections
- We're not pretentious or overly academic

**Examples:**
- "It was TikTok that introduced me to this movie, its all-knowing algorithm presenting clips it knew I'd enjoy."
- "I think the issue is, without his Factory, without the environment of magic, wonder and danger he has created, everything Wonka says and does in the grimy London that surrounds him comes across as deranged rather than enchanting."
- "She's a little bit of a bitch, tbh."

## Writing Style Guidelines

### **Tone Markers**
- **Sarcasm**: Use sparingly but effectively
- **Hyperbole**: For comedic effect, not to mislead

- Use ellipses for dramatic pause
- Employ dashes for emphasis or asides
- Use quotes around questionable terms or phrases

### **Sentence Structure**

- Vary sentence length to maintain rhythm
- Use colons and semicolons for sophisticated flow

### **Vocabulary**
- Use film industry terminology appropriately

## Content Guidelines

### **What We Do**
- Point out plot holes and inconsistencies
- Critique casting choices and performances
- Analyze technical aspects (cinematography, sound, editing)
- Compare films to their predecessors or similar works
- Call out problematic content or messaging
- Acknowledge when something is genuinely good

### **What We Don't Do**
- Attack people personally (only critique their work)
- Be mean-spirited without justification
- Ignore genuine quality when we see it
- Write in an overly academic or pretentious tone
- Shy away from controversial topics when relevant

### **Review Structure**

- Include personal reactions and observations
- End with a definitive conclusion

## Voice Examples

### **Positive Review Tone**
"All in all, this was the hopeful superman we all wanted and haven't seen on the big screen in a couple of decades. The colour pallet was cheerful in the right places, and whilst it perhaps lacked some of Snyders visual beauty, it more than overcame that with just getting the tone right."

### **Negative Review Tone**
"For some reason despite the outstanding 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the solidly mediocre 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory someone somewhere decided it was time for the Willy Wonka origin story no one asked for."

### **Observational Snark**
"Apparently 'cages' are a new innovation in Oz. (Which must make it very easy to escape from an Oz prison.)"

### **Pop Culture Reference**
"Chalamet is consistently aiming for Wilder or Depp in his performance but all I can see is Reese from Malcolm in the Middle."
